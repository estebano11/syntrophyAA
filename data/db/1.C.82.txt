<p>HP(2-20) (residues 2-20 of parental HP derived from the N-terminus of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> Ribosomal Protein L1) and its analogue, HPA3, exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Analogues, HPA3 and HPA3NT3, exert potent antibacterial effects in low-salt buffer and antifungal activity against chitin-containing fungi, while having little or no hemolytic activity or cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. HP(2-20) and its analogues interact with liposomes and disturb both neutral and negatively-charged membranes, as demonstrated by the release of encapsulated fluorescent markers (Park et al., 2007). The pore created by HP(2-20) shows that the radius is approximately 1.8 nm, whereas HPA3, HPA3NT3, and melittin have apparent radii between 3.3 and 4.8 nm. Electron microscopy showed that liposomes and various microbial cells treated with HPA3 and HPA3NT3 exhibited oligomerization and blebbing similar to that seen with melittin, while HP(2-20) exhibited flabbiness. Thus, HP(2-20) may exert its antibiotic effects through a small pore (about 1.8 nm), whereas HPA3 and HPA3NT3 formed larger pores. HPA3 pore formation is electrophoretically facilitated by trans-negative transmembrane potentials, and HPA3 peptides translocate into the trans monolayers after forming the pores (<span id='ref6060.18433718' class='cite'>Merenta <em>et al</em>., 2008</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amphipathic peptides can cause biological membranes to leak either by 
dissolving their lipid content via a detergent-like mechanism or by 
forming pores on the membrane surface. These modes of membrane damage 
have been related to the toxicity of amyloid peptides and to the 
activity of antimicrobial peptides.&nbsp;<span id='ref34555406.36095304' class='cite'>Yang <em>et al.</em> 2022</span> performed tan all-atom simulations in which membrane-bound amphipathic 
peptides self-assemble into beta-sheets that subsequently either form 
stable pores inside the bilayer or drag lipids out of the membrane 
surface. An analysis of these simulations showed that the acyl tails of 
lipids interact strongly with non-polar side chains of peptides 
deposited on the membrane. These strong interactions enable lipids to be
 dragged out of the bilayer by oligomeric structures accounting for 
detergent-like damage. They also disturb the orientation of lipid tails 
in the vicinity of peptides. These distortions are minimized around pore
 structures. Membrane-bound beta-sheets become twisted with one of their
 extremities partially penetrating the lipid bilayer. This allows 
peptides on opposite leaflets to interact and form a long transmembrane 
beta-sheet that initiates poration. In simulations, where peptides are 
deposited on a single leaflet, the twist in beta-sheets allows them to 
penetrate the membrane and form pores (<span id='ref34555408.36095304' class='cite'>Yang <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).</p>
