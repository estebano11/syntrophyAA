<p>The type 9 secretion system (T9SS) is a protein export pathway in bacteria of the Gram-negative Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes 
superphylum and is an essential determinant of pathogenicity in severe 
periodontal disease. The central element of the T9SS is a protein-conducting translocon located in the bacterial 
outer membrane. Using cryo-electron microscopy,&nbsp;<span id='ref34549183.30405243' class='cite'>Lauber <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> provided 
structural evidence that the translocon is the T9SS protein SprA. SprA 
forms a large (36-strand) single polypeptide transmembrane 
&beta;-barrel. The barrel pore is capped on the extracellular end, but has a 
lateral opening to the external membrane surface. Structures of SprA 
bound to different components of the T9SS showed that partner proteins 
control access to the lateral opening and to the periplasmic end of the 
pore. The SprA porin has a distinctive 
architecture that uses an alternating access mechanism in which the two 
ends of the protein-conducting channel are open at different times in response to the proton motive force (<em>pmf</em>).</p>
<p>T9SS substrates are large (100&ndash;650&nbsp;kDa) multi-domain proteins that 
fold in the periplasm before being exported through the outer membrane 
translocon. Substrates are targeted to the translocon by means of a ~100 aa C-terminal folded signal domain (CTD). Distinct type A and type B CTDs differ in the T9SS components required for their export (<span id='ref34549183.30405243' class='cite'>Lauber <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).</p>
<p>The Bacteroidete T9SS contains at least 15 proteins.
 GldK, GldL, GldM and GldN form a trans-periplasmic motor complex that 
is thought to use the inner membrane <em>pmf </em>to drive 
secretion at the outer membrane. PorQ, PorU, PorV and PorZ form a cell surface-exposed attachment complex that proteolytically removes the substrate CTD following transport and covalently links some substrate proteins to a lipopolysaccharide anchor.
 A pool of PorV proteins in the outer membrane may shuttle 
substrate proteins from the translocon to the attachment complex (<span id='ref34549183.30405243' class='cite'>Lauber <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). The phylum Bacteroidetes is large and diverse, with rapid gliding 
motility and the ability to digest macromolecules associated with many 
genera and species. A novel protein secretion system, the Por secretion 
system (PorSS; Type IX secretions system (T9SS)), has been identified in
 two members of the phylum, the gliding bacterium <em>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</em> and the nonmotile oral pathogen <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em>&nbsp;(<a class='reflink' href='http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.a.25#ref9735'>McBride and Zhu 2013</a>).</p>
<p>The components of the T9SS complex are not similar in sequence to 
those of other well-studied bacterial secretion systems. The <em>F. johnsoniae</em> T9SS genes are a subset of the gliding motility genes, suggesting a role for the secretory system in motility.&nbsp; <em>F. johnsoniae</em> T9SS is needed for assembly of the gliding motility apparatus and for secretion of a chitinase, and the <em>P. gingivalis</em> T9SS is involved in secretion of gingipain protease virulence factors.
 Comparative analysis of 37 genomes of members of the phylum 
Bacteroidetes revealed the widespread occurrence of gliding motility 
genes and T9SS genes. Genes associated with other bacterial protein 
secretion systems were less common. It has been suggested that gliding 
motility is common among bacteria. Microscopic 
observations confirmed that organisms previously described as nonmotile,
 including <em>Croceibacter atlanticus</em>, '<em>Gramella forsetii</em>,' <em>Paludibacter propionicigenes</em>, <em>Riemerella anatipestifer</em>, and <em>Robiginitalea biformata</em>,
 exhibit gliding motility. Three genes (<em>gldA</em>, <em>gldF</em> and <em>gldG</em>) that encode
 an apparent ATP-binding cassette transporter required for <em>F. johnsoniae</em> gliding were absent from two related gliding bacteria, suggesting that this transporter is not central to gliding motility (<a class='reflink' href='http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.a.25#ref9735'>McBride and Zhu 2013</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transport reaction believed to be catalyzed by the T9SS, energized by the <em>pmf</em>, is:</p>
