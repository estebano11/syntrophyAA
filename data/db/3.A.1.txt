<p>The ABC superfamily contains both uptake and efflux transport systems, and the members of these two porter groups generally cluster loosely together with just a few exceptions (<span id='ref6007.9873074' class='cite'>Saurin <em>et al</em>., 1999</span>). ATP hydrolysis without protein phosphorylation energizes transport. There are dozens of families within the ABC superfamily, and family generally correlates with substrate specificity. However there are exceptions. The high resolution X-ray structures of several ABC transporters, both uptake and efflux systems, have been determined, and specific details of the transport mechanisms have been proposed (<span id='ref5908.17920277' class='cite'>Davidson and Maloney, 2007</span>; <span id='ref5901.17764951' class='cite'>Lee <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>). Several multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters catalyze lipid, lipopolysaccharide, and/or lipoprotein export. This can occur by a 'flip-flop' mechanism or a 'projection' mechanism (<span id='ref7081.20412807' class='cite'>Nagao <em>et al.</em>, 2010</span>). Pag&egrave;s et al. (<span id='ref7916.21651484' class='cite'>2011</span>) have described several classes of efflux pump inhibitors that counteract MDR. Known structures have been discussed by Zolnerciks et al. (<span id='ref8304.21967051' class='cite'>2011</span>) and by <span id='ref34543870.25750732' class='cite'>Wilkens 2015</span>. Mechanistic models for the transport cycle have been compared (<span id='ref34547481.29097275' class='cite'>Sz&ouml;llősi <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). Transporters can be modified posttranslationally by phsophorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation and/or palmitoylation (<span id='ref34549155.29966598' class='cite'>Czuba <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). <span id='ref34549328.30626703' class='cite'>Ford and Beis 2019 </span>reviewed&nbsp; progress on structural determination of eukaryotic and bacterial ABC transporters as well as novel proposed mechanisms.&nbsp; There are 48 genes encoding ABC transporters in humans (<span id='ref34549664.30923664' class='cite'>Sakamoto <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>).&nbsp; 1,4-dihydropyridines are inhibitors of the transmembrane efflux pump ABCB1 in cancer cells, and they potentiate the inhibitory effect of clofazimine in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (<span id='ref34550832.31398786' class='cite'>Lentz <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Phospholipids and cholesterol are inducers of cancer multidrug resistance and therapeutic targets (<span id='ref34550991.31846838' class='cite'>Kopecka <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Multiple positions (residues) in the membrane domains of ABC transporters influence their substrate selectivities (<span id='ref34551223.32220325' class='cite'>Srikant <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). An involvement of ABC porters in cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) has been reviewed (<span id='ref34552759.33616835' class='cite'>Juan-Carlos <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>). The functional dynamics (substrate transport) of ABC transporters are realized by concerted motions, such as NBD dimerization, mechanical transmission via coupling helices, and the translocation of substrates through TMDs, which are induced by the binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP molecules and substrates (<span id='ref34552761.33634827' class='cite'>Furuta 2021</span>). Automatic algorithms have been derived that permit the large-scale identification of the solute binding protein (SBP) repertoire in proteomes (<span id='ref34555549.36121253' class='cite'>Ortega <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).&nbsp; An alternating access mechanism for many bacterial and mammalian ABC-type multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters has been reviewed (<span id='ref34556806.37367772' class='cite'>Badiee <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>). It has been proposed that ATP binding cassette transporters&nbsp; 
evolved roles in herbicide resistance through exaptation (<span id='ref34557395.37733747' class='cite'>Caygill and Dolan 2023</span>).</p>
<p>Switch and constant contact models have been presented (<span id='ref8850.22765920' class='cite'>George and Jones, 2012</span>).&nbsp; The prevailing paradigm for the ABC transport mechanism is the Switch 
Model, in which the nucleotide binding domains are proposed to dimerise 
upon binding of two ATP molecules, and thence dissociate upon sequential
 hydrolysis of the ATP. This idea appears consistent with crystal 
structures of both isolated subunits and whole transporters, as well as 
with the biochemical data. Nonetheless, an alternative
 Constant Contact Model has been proposed, in which the nucleotide 
binding domains do not fully dissociate, and ATP hydrolysis occurs 
alternately at each of the two active sites (<span id='ref9271.23131203' class='cite'>Jones and George 2012</span>).&nbsp; In this model, one of the sites remains closed and contains an
occluded nucleotide at all times. The cassettes remain in contact, and the active
sites swing open in an alternately seesawing motion. Whilst the concept of NBD
association/dissociation in the Switch Model is naturally compatible with a single alternating-access channel, the asymmetric functioning proposed by the Constant Contact model suggests an
alternating or reciprocating function in the TMDs. A new model for the function of ABC
transporters has been proposed by&nbsp;<span id='ref11095.24786414' class='cite'>Jones and George 2014</span> in which the sequence of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release in
each active site is directly coupled to the analogous sequence of substrate binding, translocation
and release in one of two functionally separate substrate translocation pathways. Each translocation
pathway functions 180 degrees out of phase.</p>
<p>As noted above, the porters of the ABC superfamily consist of two integral membrane domains/proteins and two cytoplasmic domains/proteins. The uptake systems (but not the efflux systems) usually possess extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors (one or more per system) which in Gram-negative bacteria are found in the periplasm, and in Gram-positive bacteria is present either as a lipoprotein, tethered to the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, or as a cell surface-associated protein, bound to the external membrane surface via electrostatic interactions. For those systems with two or more extracytoplasmic solute binding receptors, the receptors may interact in a cooperative fashion (<span id='ref5790.14609945' class='cite'>Biemans-Oldehinkel and Poolman, 2003</span>). These binding proteins fall into six phylogenetic clusters (<span id='ref7062.20412802' class='cite'>Berntsson <em>et al.</em>, 2010</span>). Both the integral membrane channel constituent(s) and the cytoplasmic ATP-hydrolyzing constituent(s) may be present as homodimers or heterodimers. Two families of ABC transporters have members in which one or two receptors are fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the translocating membrane protein. This suggests that two or even four substrate-binding sites may function in the complex. Possibly multiple receptors in proximity to the translocator enhances the transport rate. Multiple receptors may also broaden the substrate specificity of the system (van der <span id='ref5760.12370206' class='cite'>Heide and Poolman, 2002</span>). These systems with covalent receptor domains linked to the transmembrane translocators are found in the PAAT family (TC #3.A.1.3) and the QAT family (TC #3.A.1.12) (van der <span id='ref5760.12370206' class='cite'>Heide and Poolman, 2002</span>). Some high affinity ABC uptake systems specific for vitamins, minerals and other small molecules, called ECF systems, lack an extracytoplasm receptor and function by a mechanisms as discussed by <span id='ref10664.24362466' class='cite'>Slotboom 2014</span>. Both ECF (type I) and binding protein receptor-dependent uptake systems have been found in eukaryotes, especially in chloroplasts of algae and lower plants (<span id='ref34552880.33655617' class='cite'>Choi and Ford 2021</span>). The diversity of ABC transporter genes across the phylum Nematoda has been examined (<span id='ref34553086.33901678' class='cite'>Langeland <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>). Most of the ABCB and ABCG subfamily members are actively involved in 
heavy metal responses, and the functions
 of specific ABC transporters in Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup> stress responses is likely in soybean (<em>Glycine max</em> L.) (<span id='ref34557005.37546587' class='cite'>Naaz <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>). Some ABCG transporters in plants are likely to transport plant terpenes (<span id='ref34557296.37759481' class='cite'>Salgado <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).</p>
<p>ABC transporters always have two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs or NBSs). ATP-bound NBDs dimerize in a head-to-tail arrangement,
with two nucleotides sandwiched at the dimer interface. Upon the binding of ATP molecules to nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters undergo a conformational transition from an inward-facing (IF) to an outward-facing (OF) state via chemo-mechanical coupling. The ATP binding energy is converted into distortion energy of several transmembrane helices (<span id='ref34547806.29362701' class='cite'>Arai <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). Both NBDs contribute residues to each of the
two nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) in the dimer. The
prototypical NBD MJ0796 from <em>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</em> forms ATP-bound dimers that dissociate
completely following hydrolysis of one of the two bound ATP molecules.&nbsp; ATP hydrolysis at one nucleotide-binding site drives NBD
dissociation, but two binding sites are required to form the ATP-sandwich NBD dimer necessary for
hydrolysis (<span id='ref10444.24269240' class='cite'>Zoghbi and Altenberg 2013</span>). Single versus dimeric subunit ATPase have been discussed (<span id='ref34552077.32880928' class='cite'>Ford and Hellmich 2020</span>). Transporters with two active NBSs are called canonical transporters, while ABC exporters from eukaryotic organisms frequently have a degenerate NBS1 containing noncanonical residues that strongly impair ATP hydrolysis. The latter have been reviewed (<span id='ref34552359.33179257' class='cite'>Stockner <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). A summary of the structures available and an overview of recent structure-based studies have been discussed, while the artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictions from AlphaFold-2 are considered (<span id='ref34555913.36677553' class='cite'>Huang and Ecker 2023</span>). Eight families of MDR effux pump inhibitors, active against <em>Escherichia coli </em>or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> have been described and reviewed (<span id='ref34555927.36671381' class='cite'>Compagne <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).&nbsp; A total of 159 ABC genes were identified in the legume, <em>Cajanus cajan</em>, that belong to eight canonical classes, CcABCA to CcABCG and CcABCI (<span id='ref34557101.37624461' class='cite'>Mall <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>). Different cis-acting regulatory elements like stress, hormone, and cellular responsive were identified, and expression profiling of CcABC genes at various developmental stages of different anatomical tissues was performed.</p>
<p>Kinases can affect the activities of ABC transporters as do protein-protein interactions.&nbsp;<span id='ref34549108.29514827' class='cite'>Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> reviewed the effects of such interactions on the ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC4, and ABCG2 of humans, showing how kinases and protein-protein interactions regulate these transporters. Yeast have all of these types of ABC transporters, and a comprehensive overview of these proteins of the drug-resistant human fungal pathogen, <em>Candida glabrata</em> (<span id='ref34549396.30153284' class='cite'>Kumari <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). A comprehensive review of the classes of efflux pump inhibitors from 
various sources, highlighting their structure-activity relationships, 
which can be useful for medicinal chemists in the pursuit of novel 
efflux pump inhibitors has appeared (<span id='ref34549604.29424299' class='cite'>Dur&atilde;es <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Protein expression and functional relevance of various primary and secondary drug efflux and uptake porters at the Blood-Brain Barrier of human brain and glioblastoma have been investigated (<span id='ref34550436.31664714' class='cite'>Bao <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). ABC transporter gene expression and mutational status not surprisingly affect survival rates of cancer patients (<span id='ref34552066.32932043' class='cite'>Kadioglu <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Copper N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (CuNG) exerted different modulatory activities towards 
ABC-transporter-expressing cells. While CuNG-mediated ABC-transporter 
inhibition may improve tumor chemotherapy, CuNG-mediated enhanced ABC-transport may be a new strategy to ameliorate inflammatory diseases 
associated with decreased ABC-transporter expression as in ulcerative 
colitis (<span id='ref34556017.36854510' class='cite'>Hartinger <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).</p>
<p><span id='ref34551371.32320672' class='cite'>Acar <em>et al.</em> 2020</span> investigated the allosteric networks of three representative ABC transporters using a hybrid molecular simulations approach validated by experiments. Each of the three transporters uses a different allosteric network. In the constitutive B<sub>12</sub> importer BtuCD, ATP binding is the main driver of allostery and docking/undocking of the substrate-binding protein (SBP), which is the driven event. The allosteric signal originates at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane before propagating to the extracellular side. In the substrate-controlled maltose transporter, the SBP is the main driver of allostery, ATP binding is the driven event, and the allosteric signal propagates from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In the lipid flippase PglK, a cyclic crosstalk between ATP and substrate binding underlies allostery. These results demonstrate that speciation of biological functions may arise from variations in allosteric connectivity (<span id='ref34551371.32320672' class='cite'>Acar <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>).</p>
<p>Using mass spectrometry, <span id='ref34552136.33128234' class='cite'>Al-Majdoub <em>et al.</em> 2020</span> identified and quantified the amounts of 32 (out of 48) ABC transporters in several human tissues. ABCD3 was the most abundant in liver, whereas ABCA8, ABCB2/TAP1, and ABCE1 were detected in all tissues.They created an atlas which revealed that ABCB2/TAP1 may have TAP2-independent functions in the brain, and that livers from biliary atresia patients have quite different ABC-transporter profiles than controls. Nearly a third to half of patients with noninfectious uveitis (NIU) fail to achieve control with immunomodulatory therapy due to MDR (<span id='ref34553348.32821484' class='cite'>Tagirasa <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a rare neurocristopathy.&nbsp; ATPase transmembrane transporters, acetylglucosaminyltransferases, and phagocytic vesicle membrane proteins may contribute to the ROHHAD phenotype (<span id='ref34556694.37234859' class='cite'>Victor <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).&nbsp; Mutations in ABC genes cause 21 monogenic diseases, and polymorphisms in
 these genes are associated with susceptibility to complex diseases (<span id='ref34557888.37884430' class='cite'>Duvivier <em>et al.</em> 2024</span>). ABC
 transporters also play a major role in drug bioavailability, and they 
mediate multidrug resistance in cancer. At least 13 ABC transporters 
were shown to be involved in drug resistance in vitro.</p>
<p>The involvement of ABC transporters in transport of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants has been reviewed (<span id='ref34552732.33645051' class='cite'>Liu <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>). 49 ABC transporter genes have been divided into eight subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH), including seven ABCAs, seven ABCBs, 10 ABCCs, two ABCDs, one ABCE, three ABCFs, 16 ABCGs, and three ABCHs according to phylogenetic analysis in <em>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</em>, a highly destructive insect pest of cucurbitaceous and other related crops (<span id='ref34553047.33806814' class='cite'>Xu <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>). Transporter-mediated natural product-drug interactions have been reviewed for transporters in several different families (<span id='ref34554611.35304735' class='cite'>Bi <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). The new AlphaFold protein structure prediction tool predicts a new type of transmembrane domain fold within the ABC transporters that is associated with cation exporters of bacteria and plants (<span id='ref34555480.36151373' class='cite'>Younus <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).</p>
<p>Plant MRPs, or GS-X pumps (glutathione-conjugate or multispecific organic anion Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases,&nbsp; participate in the transport of exogenous and endogenous amphipathic anions and glutathionated compounds, usually from the cytosol into the vacuole. Encoded by a multigene family and possessing a unique domain organization, the types of processes that likely converge and depend on plant MRPs include herbicide detoxification, cell pigmentation, the alleviation of oxidative damage, and the storage of antimicrobial compounds. Additional functional capabilities might include channel regulation of activity and/or the transport of heavy metal chelates (<span id='ref34553269.15012252' class='cite'>Rea <em>et al.</em> 1998</span>).</p>
<p>The TC system of classification uses the integral membrane proteins, not the energy coupling proteins, receptor, or auxiliary subunits to classify the system into families (<span id='ref9114.8177172' class='cite'>Saier, 1994</span>; <span id='ref9115.10839820' class='cite'>2000</span>). The exception to this rule was the ABC superfamily which by engrained tradition was classified based on the use of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase for energy coupling before the TC system was designed. Since then it has become known that the membrane proteins of ABC export systems fall into three evolutionarily distinct families that followed three different pathways of origin (<span id='ref7189.19806386' class='cite'>Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span>). These have been designated ABC1, ABC2 and ABC3. ABC1 porters arose by triplication of a primordial 2 TMS element; ABC2 porters arose by duplication of a 3 TMS element, and ABC3 porters arose from a 4 TMS precursor that either remained as two 4 TMS proteins (a homo or hetero dimer) or internally duplicated to give 8 or 10 proteins, the extra two appear to be in the center between the two 4 TMS repeat units (<span id='ref9143.15748994' class='cite'>Khwaja <em>et al.</em> 2005</span>). The ABC functional superfamily therefore consists of at least three true superfamilies. The ABC subfamiies or clusters that belong to each of these three superfamilies are listed below. In addition, the LPS effluxing transport system family with TC# 3.A.152 may be unrelated to the other three exporter superfamilies (<span id='ref34552879.32978974' class='cite'>Thomas <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Based on 3-D structures, there may also be three types of integral membrane ABC uptake systems, bringing the total to 7 types (<span id='ref34552879.32978974' class='cite'>Thomas <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>).</p>
<p>Energy-coupling factor (ECF)-type ABC importers appear to fulfil important roles in both algae and plants where they form the ABCI sub-family.&nbsp;<span id='ref34552880.33655617' class='cite'>Choi and Ford 2021</span> discussed whether bacterial Type I and Type II ABC importers are present in extant eukaryotes. Type I importers exist in algae and the liverwort family of primitive non-vascular plants, but not in higher plants. The existence of eukaryotic Type II importers is also supported: a transmembrane protein homologous to vitamin B12 import system transmembrane protein (BtuC), hemin transport system transmembrane protein (HmuU) and high-affinity zinc uptake system membrane protein (ZnuB) is encoded within the <em>Cyanophora paradoxa</em> genome. This last protein has homologs within the genomes of red algae. Furthermore, its candidate nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) shows closest similarity to other bacterial Type II importer NBDs such as BtuD. Functional studies suggest that Type I importers have roles in maintaining sulphate levels in the chloroplast, while Type II importers probably act as importers of Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> , as inferred by comparisons with bacterial homologs. Possible explanations for the presence of these transporters in simple plants, but not in other eukaryotic organisms, are considered (<span id='ref34552880.33655617' class='cite'>Choi and Ford 2021</span>). In order to utilise the existing nomenclature for eukaryotic ABC proteins, it was proposed that eukaryotic Type I and II importers be classified as ABCJ and ABCK transporters, respectively.</p>

<p>Uptake systems (TC#s 3.A.1.1 - 3.A.1.34) may be largely of the ABC2 type, but they have undergone extensive sequence and topological diversification. They even have different 3-dimensional structural differences, suggesting that they may have different origins. The only exception is ABC family 3.A.1.21, the Siderophore-Fe<sup>3+</sup>&nbsp;Uptake Transporter (SIUT) Family which is clearly of the ABC1 type. It has no extracytoplasmic receptor as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABC importers have been divided into two classes: type I importers follow 
an alternating access mechanism driven by the presence of the substrate, while type II importers accept substrates in a
nucleotide-free state, with hydrolysis driving an inward-facing 
conformation.&nbsp; RbsABC<sub>2</sub> (TC#3.A.1.2.1) seems to share functional traits with both type I and type II importers, as
well as possessing unique features, and may employ a distinct mechanism relative to other ABC
transporters (<a class='reflink' href='../../search/#ref34543711'>Clifton <em>et al.</em> 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike most uptake systems which have one or two functionally equivalent membrane subunits that form a homo- or hetero-dimer and an extracytoplasmic receptor, a subset of these porters have two functionally dissimilar membrane subunits, called S (substrate recognition) and T (energy transducer) that are very divergent in sequence, and they lack extracytoplasmic receptors (<span id='ref8692.22574898' class='cite'>Erkens <em>et al.</em> 2012</span>). This group of ABC porters represent a subfamily within the ABC uptake systems. This subset, called Energy-coupling Factor 'ECF' porters, includes:</p>
<p>ECF:<br />3.A.1.18 The Cobalt Uptake Transporter (CoT) Family&nbsp;<br />3.A.1.22 The Nickel Uptake Transporter (NiT) Family<br />3.A.1.23 The Nickel/Cobalt Uptake Transporter (NiCoT) Family<br />3.A.1.25 The Biotin Uptake Transporter (BioMNY) Family<br />3.A.1.26 The Putative Thiamine Uptake Transporter (ThiW) Family<br />3.A.1.28 The Queuosine (Queuosine) Family<br />3.A.1.29 The Methionine Precursor (Met-P) Family<br />3.A.1.30 The Thiamin Precursor (Thi-P) Family<br />3.A.1.31 The Unknown-ABC1 (U-ABC1) Family<br />3.A.1.32 The Cobalamin Precursor (B<sub>12</sub>-P) Family<br />3.A.1.33 The Methylthioadenosine (MTA) Family<br />S-subunits are homologous to:<br />2.A.87 The Prokaryotic Riboflavin Transporter (P-RFT) Family<br />2.A.88 The Vitamin Uptake Transporter (VUT or ECF) Family</p>
<p>Karpowich and Wang (<span id='ref9597.23359690' class='cite'>2013</span>) characterized the ECF transporters from <em>Thermotoga maritima</em> and 
<em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em> and determined a subunit stoichiometry of
 2S:2T:1A:1A'.&nbsp; They concluded that S subunits for different substrates can be 
incorporated into the same transporter complex simultaneously. In the crystal structure of the A-A' heterodimer, each subunit contains a
 novel motif called the Q-helix that plays a role in subunit 
coupling with the T subunits. A 
mechanism for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to <span class='highlight'>transmembrane</span> <span class='highlight'>transport</span> by ECF transporters was proposed. ECF porters mediate the uptake of micronutrients in prokaryotes, and consist of two ATP-binding-cassette family ATPases, a transmembrane coupling protein (T component) and a substrate-binding membrane protein (S component), as noted above. ECF transporters for Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions have one or two additional proteins with extracytoplasmic regions. Homologs of T components with predicted localization in plastids are widespread in plants, but S components in eukaryotes are rare and restricted to biotin-specific variants (<span id='ref34550855.31283960' class='cite'>Finkenwirth and Eitinger 2019</span>). Apart from a potential contribution to the export of flavins to serve the assembly of extracytoplasmic electron transfer chains, ECF transporters function as importers.</p>
<p>The maltose import transporter is composed of two TM subunits, MalF and MalG, and two subunits of a cytoplasmic ATPase, MalK. Like many uptake systems in Gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), is required to stimulate the ATPase activity of the transporter. In the absence of maltose, MBP exists in equilibrium between an open and closed conformation, and binding of maltose stabilizes the closed conformation. Two structures of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> have been determined by x-ray crystallography. In the absence of MBP, MalFGK<sub>2</sub> forms an inward-facing conformation with the TM maltose-binding site exposed to the cytoplasm. An outward-facing conformation, crystallized in complex with open MBP and ATP, shows that closure of the NBDs of MalK is concomitant with transfer of maltose from MBP to the TM subunits. These structures capture two states in the transport cycle: The inward-facing conformation represents the resting state where the transporter has a very low ATPase activity, and the outward-facing conformation represents a catalytic intermediate where ATP is poised for hydrolysis. Because MBP stimulates ATP hydrolysis and initiates the transport process, it must interact with the resting state conformation to form a 'pretranslocation' complex that is metastable in order to advance to the outward-facing conformation in the presence of ATP (25). Oldham and Chen (<span id='ref7802.21566157' class='cite'>2011</span>) presented the crystal structure of the initial complex formed between closed MBP and MalFGK<sub>2</sub>. As an essential intermediate between the inward- and outward-facing conformations, this structure suggests a mechanism by which substrate bound on the periplasmic surface influences the conformation of the NBDs at the intracellular surface. The same investigators suggested that ABC transporters catalyze ATP hydrolysis via a general base mechanism (<span id='ref8266.21825153' class='cite'>Oldham and Chen, 2011</span>).</p>
<p>The homodimeric LmrA drug efflux pump (TC #3.A.1.117.1) of <em>Lactococcus lactis</em> appears to function by an alternating site (half of sites) type mechanism. In many of these porters, the various domains are fused in a variety of combinations. Uptake porters generally have their constituents as distinct polypeptide chains, while efflux systems usually have them fused. ABC-type uptake systems have not been identified in eukaryotes, but ABC-type efflux systems abound in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The eukaryotic efflux systems often have the four domains (two cytoplasmic domains and two integral membrane domains) fused into either one or two polypeptide chains. The integral membrane porter domains each usually possesses 5 (uptake) or 6 (efflux) transmembrane spanners, but exceptions exist. For example, the MntB protein (TC #3.A.1.15.1) exhibits 9 established TMSs. The 3-dimensional structure of the <em>E. coli</em> MsbA protein (TC #3.A.1.106.1) has been solved to a resolution of 3.7 &Aring; (<span id='ref5926.18024585' class='cite'>Ward <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>), that of the <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> Sav1866 protein (TC #3.A.1.106.2) has been solved to a resolution of 3.0 &Aring; (<span id='ref5857.16943773' class='cite'>Dawson and Locher, 2006</span>), that of the <em>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</em> ModABC complex has been solved at 3.1 &Aring; resolution (<span id='ref5880.17322901' class='cite'>Hollenstein <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>), that of the <em>E. coli</em> BtuCDF Vitamin B12 transporter was solved at 2.6 &Aring; resolution (<span id='ref5896.17673622' class='cite'>Hvorup <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>), and the maltose transporter has been solved at 2.8 &Aring; resolution (<span id='ref5928.18033289' class='cite'>Oldham <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>). These structures are very different, but the two transmembrane domains form a single barrel 5-6 nm in diameter and about 5 nm deep with an entral pore open either to the external or internal surface spanning much of the membrane (<span id='ref5768.12501241' class='cite'>Rosenberg <em>et al</em>., 2003</span>). A model has been proposed allowing the channel to open up to the lipid bilayer. A half of sites model in which the two nucleotide binding domains interact in a fashion controlled by substrate binding has also been proposed (<span id='ref5767.12458196' class='cite'>Hou <em>et al</em>., 2003</span>; <span id='ref5763.12421806' class='cite'>Loo <em>et al</em>., 2003</span>).</p>
<p><span style='font-family: Times;'>Hollenstein et al. (<span id='ref5880.17322901' class='cite'>2007</span>) presented the 3.1 &Aring; crystal structure of a putative molybdate transporter (ModB<sub>2</sub></span>C<sub>2</sub>) from <em>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</em> in complex with its binding protein (ModA). Twelve transmembrane helices of the ModB subunits provide an inward-facing conformation, with a closed gate near the external membrane boundary. The ATP-hydrolyzing ModC subunits reveal a nucleotide-free, open conformation, whereas the attached binding protein aligns the substrate-binding cleft with the entrance to the presumed translocation pathway. Structural comparison of ModB<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>A with Sav1866 suggests a common alternating access and release mechanism, with binding of ATP promoting an outward-facing conformation and dissociation of the hydrolysis products promoting an inward-facing conformation.&nbsp;ATP hydrolysis at one of the two sites in ABC transporters initiates transport-related conformational transitions (<span id='ref8546.21840296' class='cite'>Gyimesi <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>).</p>
<p><span id='ref6579.19278995' class='cite'>Smriti <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> mapped residues proximal to the daunorubicin
(DNR)-binding site in MsbA (TC#3.A.1.106.1) using site-specific, ATP-dependent quenching
of DNR intrinsic fluorescence by spin labels. In the nucleotide-free
MsbA intermediate, DNR-binding residues cluster at the cytoplasmic end
of helices 3 and 6 at a site accessible from the membrane/water
interface and extending into an aqueous chamber formed at the interface
between the two transmembrane domains. Binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP
analog inverts the transporter to an outward-facing conformation. DNR may thus enter near an elbow helix parallel to the
water/membrane interface, partitioning into the open chamber, and then
translocating toward the periplasm upon ATP binding.</p>
<p>The turnover rates of some transporters are inhibited by their substrates in a process termed trans-inhibition. Gerber et al. (<span id='ref5953.18511655' class='cite'>2008</span>) presented the crystal structure of a molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter (ModBC) from <em>Methanosarcina acetivorans</em> in a trans-inhibited state. The regulatory domains of the nucleotide-binding subunits proved to be in close contact, providing two oxyanion binding pockets at the shared interface. By specifically binding to these pockets, molybdate or tungstate prevent adenosine triphosphatase activity and lock the transporter in an inward-facing conformation, with the catalytic motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains separated. This allosteric effect prevents the transporter from switching between the inward-facing and the outward-facing states, thus interfering with the alternating access and release mechanism.</p>
<p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; 3.A.1.202.1) is an
ATP-dependent chloride channel. <span id='ref6453.19020075' class='cite'>Jordan <em>et al.</em>, 2008</span> compared CFTR protein sequences to
those of ABCC4 proteins (the closest mammalian paralogs) to identify the evolutionary transition
from transporter to channel activity. R352 in the
sixth transmembrane helix interacts with D993 in TM9 to stabilize the open-channel state; D993 is
absolutely conserved between CFTRs and ABCC4s. Thus
CFTR channel activity evolved, at least in part, by converting the
conformational changes associated with binding and hydrolysis of ATP,
as are found in true ABC transporters, into an open permeation pathway
by means of intraprotein interactions that stabilize the open state.&nbsp; In general, plant ABC transport systems are more numerous than those in animals.&nbsp; The maize systems have been categorized and their expression profiles have been determined (<span id='ref10228.23747399' class='cite'>Pang <em>et al.</em> 2013</span>).</p>
<p>The LolCDE complex of <em>Escherichia coli</em> (TC# 3.A.1.125.1) initiates the lipoprotein sorting to the outer membrane by catalysing their release from the inner membrane. LolC and/or LolE, membrane subunits, recognize lipoproteins anchored to the outer surface of the inner membrane, while LolD hydrolyses ATP on its inner surface. The ligand-bound LolCDE has been purified from the inner membrane in the absence of ATP (<span id='ref5866.17038124' class='cite'>Ito <em>et al</em>., 2006</span>). Liganded LolCDE represents an intermediate of the release reaction and exhibits higher affinity for ATP than the unliganded form. ATP binding to LolD weakens the interaction between LolCDE and lipoproteins and causes their dissociation in a detergent solution, while lipoprotein release from membranes requires ATP hydrolysis. A single molecule of lipoprotein is found to bind per molecule of the LolCDE complex.</p>
<p>The three structurally dissimilar constituents of the ABC uptake porters have generally arisen from a common ancestral porter system with minimal shuffling of constituents between/domain constituents is almost always the same. However the rates of sequence divergences differ drastically with the extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors diverging most rapidly, the integral-membrane, channel-forming constituents diverging at an intermediate rate, and the cytoplasmic ATP-hydrolyzing constituents diverging most slowly. Thus, all ATP-hydrolyzing constituents are demonstrably homologous, but this is not true for the integral membrane constituents or the receptors. Nevertheless, clustering patterns are generally the same for all three types of proteins, and 3-dimensional structural data suggest that, in spite of their extensive sequence divergence, the extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors are homologous to each other.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the known ABC transporters, ABCC1 (TC #3.A.1.208.8) has an additional membrane-spanning domain (MSD) at its amino terminus with a domain arrangement of MSD0-MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2. The additional MSD0 domain consists of five putative transmembrane segments with a predicted extracellular amino terminus. It has a U-shaped folding with the bottom of the U-structure facing cytoplasm and both ends in extracellular space. This U-shaped amino terminus probably functions as a gate to regulate the drug transport activity of human ABCC1 (<span id='ref5854.16914551' class='cite'>Chen <em>et al</em>., 2006</span>).</p>
<p>Polar lipid trafficking is essential in eukaryotic cells as membranes of lipid assembly are often distinct from final destination membranes. A striking example is the biogenesis of the photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids) in plastids of plants. Lipid biosynthetic enzymes at the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner and outer plastid envelope membranes are involved. This compartmentalization requires extensive lipid trafficking. Mutants of <em>Arabidopsis</em> disrupt the incorporation of endoplasmic reticulum-derived lipid precursors into thylakoid lipids. Two proteins affected in two of these mutants, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1 (TGD1) and TGD2, encode the permease and substrate binding component, respectively, of a proposed lipid translocator at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. A third protein, TGD3, a small ABC-type ATPase, energizer transport. As in the tgd1 and tgd2 mutants, triacylglycerols and trigalactolipids accumulate in a tgd3 mutant. The TGD3 protein shows basal ATPase activity and is localized inside the chloroplast beyond the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Proteins orthologous to TGD1, -2, and -3 are predicted to be present in Gram-negative bacteria, and the respective genes are organized in operons suggesting a common biochemical role for the gene products. The Tgd1,2,3 system (TC#3.A.1.27.2) probably transfers ER-derived lipids to the thylakoid membrane (<span id='ref5914.17938172' class='cite'>Lu <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>). It is one of the few known eukaryotic uptake systems.</p>
<p><span id='ref6327.18931129' class='cite'>Rodionov <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> identified 21 families of these substrate capture proteins, each with a different specificity predicted by genome context analyses. Roughly half of the substrate capture proteins (335 cases) examined by <span id='ref6327.18931129' class='cite'>Rodionov <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> have a dedicated energizing module, but in 459 cases distributed among almost 100 gram-positive bacteria, different and unrelated substrate capture proteins share the same energy-coupling module. The shared use of energy-coupling modules was experimentally confirmed for folate, thiamine, and riboflavin transporters. <span id='ref6327.18931129' class='cite'>Rodionov <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> proposed the name energy-coupling factor transporters for the new class of putative ABC membrane transporters. These membrane proteins are homologues to ABC-2 exporters. When evidence is minimal for association with an ABC-type ATP-hydrolyzing subunit, these porters are placed in category 2.A (secondary carriers; e.g., 2.A.88).</p>
<p>Canonical ABC importers play important roles in cell integrity, environmental stresses, cell-to-cell communication, cell differentiation and pathogenicity. An ABC sub-superfamily of micronutrient importers, the 'energy-coupling factor' (ECF) transporters, use ABC ATPases. Fundamental differences between tranditional ABC and ECF porters include the modular architecture and the independence of ECF systems of extracytoplasmic solute-binding proteins. Eitinger et al. (<span id='ref7868.20497229' class='cite'>2011</span>) review the roles of both types of transporters in diverse physiological processes including pathogenesis. They also point out the differences and similarities in modular assembly and their traits.</p>
<p>The uptake porters of the ABC superfamily and of the vitamin/small molecule transporters described by <span id='ref6327.18931129' class='cite'>Rodionov <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> are homologous to the porters in the VUT family (2.A.88). In fact, studies indicated that all uptake porters of the ABC superfamily are of the ABC2 type (<span id='ref34549432.23647830' class='cite'>Zheng <em>et al.</em> 2013</span>). When evidence suggests that homologous membrane transport proteins of the ABC2 type couple transport to ATP hydrolysis using a homologue of the ABC-type ATPases, we list these proteins in the ABC superfamily. If there is no such evidence, (e.g., experimental evidence and the occurrence of the gene for the membrane transporter protein is in an operon that lacks the ATPase and auxillary subunit) then the porter is placed into family 2.A.88.</p>
<p>Ter Beek et al. (<span id='ref7496.21135102' class='cite'>2011</span>) have determined the subunit stoichiometry and functional unit of the energy coupling factor (ECF)-type of ABC 
transporters (<span id='ref6318.18931129' class='cite'>Rodionov <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span>). ECF transporters consist of a conserved energizing module (two 
peripheral ATPases and the integral membrane protein EcfT) and an integral membrane protein responsible for substrate 
specificity (S-component). S-components for different substrates&nbsp; 
may associate with the same 
energizing module. The energizing module from <em>Lactococcus lactis</em> has been shown to form stable complexes with each of the eight predicted 
S-components found in this organism. Using light scattering, EcfT, the two 
ATPases (EcfA and EcfA'), and the S-component were found to be present 
in a stoichiometric 1:1:1:1 ratio. The complexes were reconstituted in proteoliposomes 
and shown to mediate ATP-dependent transport. ECF-type transporters are 
the smallest known ABC transporters.</p>
<p>Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a subgroup of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the uptake of vitamins and micronutrients in prokaryotes. In contrast to classical ABC importers, ECF transporters do not make use of water-soluble substrate binding proteins or domains but instead employ integral membrane proteins for substrate binding (S-components or EcfS). S-components form active translocation complexes with the ECF module, an assembly of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs, or EcfA) and a second transmembrane 'energy transducer' protein, EcfT. In many cases, the ECF module can interact with several different S-components that bind diverse substrates. The modular organization with exchangeable S-components on a single ECF module allows the transport of chemically different substrates via a common route. The determination of the crystal structures of the S-components that recognize thiamin and riboflavin provided clues about the mechanism of S-component exchange. Erkens et al. (<span id='ref8692.22574898' class='cite'>2012</span>) described current views of the transport mechanism by ECF transporters.</p>
<p>Some ABC exporters act on protein substrates. Export depends on the ABC transporter, a periplasmic 'adapter', the membrane fusion proteins (MFPs; 8.A.1) and an outer membrane factor (OMF; 1.B.17). Assembly of the tripartite complex can be transient and induced upon binding of the substrate to the ABC protein.&nbsp;<span id='ref7384.20418390' class='cite'>Masi &amp; Wandersman (2010)</span> showed that in addition to the C-terminal targeting sequence, many additional signals throughout the substrate protein facilitate secretion. Interaction of the C-terminal 'targeting' signal activates the ATPase activity, causing disassembly of the complex. Thus, the proposed 'targeting' motif may signal dissociation rather than targeting (<span id='ref7384.20418390' class='cite'>Masi &amp; Wandersman <em>et al.</em>, 2010</span>). Dassa and Bouige (<span id='ref5737.11421270' class='cite'>2001</span>) have devised a phylogenetic/functional classification system for ABC transporters that overlaps the TC system. In their system, several of the TC families are included in single families. These reveal the closer phylogenetic relationship of TC families as follows:</p>
<p>Jones &amp; George (<span id='ref8343.22369471' class='cite'>2012</span>) reported molecular dynamics simulations of the ATP/apo and ATP/ADP states of the bacterial ABC exporter Sav1866 (TC#3.A.1.106.2). Conformers of the active site have a canonical geometry for an in-line nucleophilic attack on the ATP &gamma;-phosphate. The conserved glutamate immediately downstream of the Walker B motif is the catalytic base, forming a dyad with the H-loop histidine, while the Q-loop glutamine has an organising role. Each D-loop provides a coordinating residue of the attacking water, and comparison with the simulation of the ATP/ADP state suggested that via their flexibility, the D-loops modulate formation of the hydrolysis-competent state. A global switch involving a coupling helix delineates the signal transmission route by which allosteric control of ATP hydrolysis in ABC transporters is mediated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binding of ATP to the nucleotide binding
domains (NBDs) of ABC proteins drives the dimerization of NBDs, which, in turn, causes large
conformational changes within the transmembrane domains.&nbsp; NBD dimerization proceeds with a
large gain of water entropy when ATP molecules bind to the NBDs. The energetic gain arising from
direct NBD-NBD interactions is canceled by the dehydration penalty and the configurational-entropy
loss. ATP hydrolysis induces a loss of the shape complementarity between the NBDs, which leads to
the dissociation of the dimer, due to a decrease in the water-entropy gain and an increase in the
configurational-entropy loss (<span id='ref34543602.25302667' class='cite'>Hayashi <em>et al.</em> 2014</span>).</p>
<p>ABC proteins play critical roles in maintaining lipid and sterol homeostasis in higher eukaryotes. In human, several subfamily-A and -G members function as cholesterol transporters across the cellular membranes. Deficiencies of these ABC proteins can cause dyslipidemia that is associated with health conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and neurodegeneration (<span id='ref34548689.30058354' class='cite'>Xavier <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). The physiological roles of ABC cholesterol transporters have been implicated in mediating cholesterol efflux for reverse cholesterol transport and in maintaining membrane integrity for cell survival.&nbsp; The membrane constituents of ABC transporters may play key roles in determining the transport substrates and the translocation mechanisms via the transmembrane domains. High resolution structures of human sterol transporter ABCG5/G8 and its functional homologs have shed light on the structural features of ABC transporters.&nbsp;<span id='ref34548689.30058354' class='cite'>Xavier <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> outlined what is known about ABCG cholesterol transporters, addressed key structural features in the putative sterol translocation pathway on the transmembrane domains, and concluded by proposing a mechanistic model of ABC cholesterol transporters.</p>
<p>ABC peptide/protein exporters are usuallly believed to export their substrates directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium without a periplasmic intermediate.&nbsp; However, a subgroup of systems, linked with a bacterial transglutaminase-like
 cysteine proteinase (BTLCP) apparently uses a two-step secretion mechanism.
 BTLCP-linked T1SSs <span class='highlight'>transport</span> a class of repeats-in-toxin (RTX) adhesins that are critical for 
biofilm formation. The prototype of this RTX adhesin group, LapA of <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> Pf0-1, uses a <span class='highlight'>novel</span> N-terminal retention module to anchor the adhesin at the cell surface 
as a secretion intermediate threaded through the outer 
membrane-localized TolC-like <span class='highlight'>protein</span> LapE. This secretion intermediate is posttranslationally cleaved by the BTLCP <span class='highlight'>family</span> LapG <span class='highlight'>protein</span> to release LapA from its cognate T1SS pore. Thus, the secretion of LapA
 and related RTX adhesins into the extracellular environment appears to 
be a T1SS-mediated two-step process that involves a periplasmic 
intermediate (<span id='ref34549034.29866808' class='cite'>Smith <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).</p>
<p>The ABC-F family comprises an extremely diverse set of cytoplasmic ATPase proteins. All of the proteins in the ABC-F family characterized act on the ribosome and are translation factors (<span id='ref34550813.31563533' class='cite'>Ousalem <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Their common function is ATP-dependent modulation of the stereochemistry of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in the ribosome coupled to changes in its global conformation and P-site tRNA binding geometry. <span id='ref34550813.31563533' class='cite'>Ousalem <em>et al.</em> 2019</span> presented an overview of the function, structure, and theories for the mechanisms-of-action of microbial ABC-F proteins including those involved in mediating resistance to ribosome-binding antibiotics.</p>
<p><span id='ref34554790.35584005' class='cite'>Xiao <em>et al.</em> 2022</span> identified 87 ABC transporter genes in the genomes of<em> Tenebrio molitor</em> as well as those from <em>Asbolus verrucosus</em> (104), <em>Hycleus cichorii</em> (65), and <em>Hycleus</em><em> phaleratus</em> (80). Combining these genes (336 in total) with published genes reported for <em>Tribolium castaneum</em>, the phylogeny of ABC transporter genes in all five Tenebrionids were analyzed. They were assigned to eight subfamilies (ABCA-H). In comparison to other species, the ABCC subfamily in this group of beetles appears expanded. The expression profiles of the <em>T. molitor</em> genes at different life stages and in various tissues were also investigated using transcriptomic analysis. Most of them display developmental specific expression patterns, suggesting their possible roles in development. Most of them are highly expressed in detoxification-related tissues including the gut and Malpighian tubule, from which roles in insecticide resistance were suggested. We detected specific or abundant expression of many ABC transporter genes in various tissues such as salivary gland, ovary, testis, and antenna (<span id='ref34554790.35584005' class='cite'>Xiao <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).</p>
<p>Dassa and Bouige (<span id='ref5737.11421270' class='cite'>2001</span>) summarized the protein and domain organization of each of the various family-type proteins (see Table 1). Based on the structures, a general mechanism for ABC transporters has been proposed, known as the Switch or Alternating Access Model, which holds that the NBDs are widely separated, with the TMDs and NBDs together forming an intracellular-facing inverted 'V' shape. Binding of two ATPs and the substrate to the inward-facing conformation induces a transition to an outward conformation. Despite this apparent progress, certainty around the transport mechanism for any given ABC remains elusive (<span id='ref34555998.36768947' class='cite'>Jones and George 2023</span>). How substrate binding and transport is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis is not known, and there is a large body of biochemical and biophysical data that is at odds with widely separated NBDs being a functional/physiological state. An alternative Constant Contact model has been proposed in which the two NBSs operate 180 degrees out of phase with respect to ATP hydrolysis, with the NBDs remaining in close proximity throughout the transport cycle and operating in an asymmetric allosteric manner (<span id='ref34555998.36768947' class='cite'>Jones and George 2023</span>).</p>

The maltose-binding protein is open in the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis during maltose transport (<span id="ref34551924.15117946" class="cite">Austermuhle <em>et al.</em> 2004</span>).

(<a class="reflink" href="result.php?tc=3.A.1#ref8594">2012</a>) reviewed the extensive knowledge available on MalEFGK<sub>2</sub>, its mode of action and its regulatory interactions.&nbsp; The transporter sequesters the MalT transcriptional activator at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in the absence of the transport substrate (<a class="reflink" href="result.php?tc=3.A.1#ref9227">Richet <em>et al.</em> 2012</a>).&nbsp; The crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK<sub>2</sub> bound with
 large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states have also been determined. In 
the pretranslocation structure,&nbsp;<a class="reflink" href="result.php?tc=3.A.1#ref10407">Oldham <em>et al.</em> 2013</a> found that the transmembrane subunit 
MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing
 end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmrembrane subunit MalF
 binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end. These
 structural features explain why large modified malto-oligosaccharides are not
 transported by MalFGK<sub>2</sub> despite their high binding affinity to MBP. In the transport cycle, substrate is channeled from MBP

MalFGK<sub>2</sub> contribute to the overall substrate selectivity of the system (<a class="reflink" href="result.php?tc=3.A.1#ref10407">Oldham <em>et al.</em> 2013</a>).&nbsp; Stabilization of the semi-open
MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP
hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the
semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP (<span id="ref34544347.26268698" class="cite">Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>).

The pit is a novel organ acquired through the fluidity and reconstitution of cell surface molecules, and through cooperation with the transport machinery in the cells.  It confers upon bacterial cells a more efficient way to secure and assimilate macromolecules (<span id="ref6877.18256495" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em>, 2008</span>).&nbsp; The substrate-transport characteristics and quaternary structure of AlgM1M2SS with AlgQ1 have been determined (<span id="ref34544363.26235029" class="cite">Maruyama <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>). The addition
of poly- or oligoalginate enhanced the ATPase activity of reconstituted AlgM1M2SS coupled with one
of the periplasmic solute-binding proteins, AlgQ1 or AlgQ2. External fluorescence-labeled
oligoalginates were specifically imported into AlgM1M2SS-containing proteoliposomes in the presence
of AlgQ2, ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The crystal structure of AlgQ2-bound AlgM1M2SS adopts an inward-facing
conformation. The interaction between AlgQ2 and AlgM1M2SS induces the formation of an alginate-binding tunnel-like structure accessible to solvent. The translocation route inside the
transmembrane domains contains charged residues suitable for the import of acidic saccharides (<span id="ref34544363.26235029" class="cite">Maruyama <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bacterium&nbsp; is a Gram-negative rod, containing 
glycosphingolipids in the cell envelope, and is named <em>Sphingomonas</em> sp. 
strain A1 (<span id="ref34555651.36504195" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). The pit was dynamic, with repetitive opening and closing 
during growth on alginate, and directly included alginate concentrated 
around the pit, particularly by flagellins, alginate-binding proteins, 
localized on the cell surface. Alginate incorporated into the periplasm 
was subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by cooperative 
interactions of periplasmic solute-binding proteins and an ATP-binding 
cassette transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The mechanisms of 
assembly, functions, and interactions between the above-mentioned 
molecules were clarified using structural biology. The pit was 
transplanted into other strains of sphingomonads, and the pitted 
recombinant cells were effectively applied to the production of 
bioethanol, bioremediation for dioxin removal (<span id="ref34555652.36504195" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). The outer membranes of <em>Sphingomonas</em> strains contain GSL and is 
different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria, which contain LPSs 
in their cell envelope. Because of this property, the cell 
surface of <em>Sphingomonas</em> strains is more hydrophobic than that 
of other Gram-negative bacteria and shows high affinity toward 
hydrophobic chemicals such as dioxin and polypropylene glycol.</p>
<p>Strain A1 cells use polyuronates (alginate and pectin) and 
their depolymerization products as carbon sources for growth. 
Glucose and pyruvate can be utilized as carbon sources, but far 
less efficiently than polyuronates.
 Strain A1 cells grew well on alginate and oligoalginates with different
 M/G ratios at pH 6&ndash;7, 30 ℃ in aerobic conditions, with a doubling time 
of approximately 25 min. However, unlike almost all of the 
alginate-degrading bacteria analyzed to date,<sup> </sup>the cells of 
strain A1 contained most of their alginate lyases in the cytoplasm. This
 means that alginate in the medium has to enter the cells in order to 
make contact with alginate lyases (<span id="ref34555652.36504195" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).</p>
<p>The morphological characteristics of the cell surface were examined with
 cells of strain A1 grown in the presence or absence of alginate. The following morphological observations were made (<a class="reflink" href="../../search/result.php?tc=3.A.33#ref34555651">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</a>): (i) cells grown on 
alginate were of two types that always coexisted in the medium: cells 
with or without a pit,
 and this feature was not observed in the absence of alginate. (ii) The 
surface of cells grown in the absence of alginate showed a pleat-like 
structure without a pit. (iii) Cells grown in the presence of alginate produced pits on their cell surface, and
 The pits contained even globular particles, some of which were 
insoluble forms (granules) of alginate. (iv) When the alginate-grown 
cells were treated with ruthenium red, an agent used to stain 
mucopolysaccharides, the pit periphery was strongly and specifically 
stained,
 suggesting that alginate was concentrated in the pit. (v) The thin 
section of cells grown on alginate showed a specific region where the 
cell surface sunk into the cells but no such structures were observed in cells grown in the absence of 
alginate. (vi) The average pit size was 0.02&ndash;0.1 &micro;m in diameter (<span id="ref34555652.36504195" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). Thus,  (a) the pit is formed only in the presence of alginate, (b) the pit 
functions as a concentrator of alginate, and (c) strain A1 cells have a 
pit-dependent alginate assimilation system, which differs from the 
alginate import and degradation pathway of other alginate-degrading 
microbes.</p>
<p>There are six protein constituents in the ABC transporter: AlgQ1, Q2,
 M1 M2 and S (AlgS is present with two copies where Q1 and 2 are 
periplasmic binding proteins, M1 and M2 comprise the integral membrane 
transport channel, and S is the dimeric ATPase. Alginate accumulated in 
the pit is delivered into the periplasm and then
 transported to the cytoplasm by this ABC transporter. Alginate is 
finally degraded into constituent monosaccharides by alginate lyases 
present in the cytoplasm. The gene cluster encoding these proteins are 
AlgO (regulatory protein)-AlgS-AlgM1-AlgM2-AlgQ1-AlgQ2. There are 8 cell
 surface proteins, p1 - p8.&nbsp; P1 - p4 are TonB-dependent outer membrane 
transporters; p5 and p6 are flagellin-like proteins with alterred 
central domains of ~150 aas and high affinity for alginate (Kd = 10<sup>-9</sup>), and p7 and p8 are periplasmic alginate binding proteins (<span id="ref34555652.36504195" class="cite">Murata <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Proteobacteria</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>AlgSM1M2Q1 of <em>Sphingomonas </em>sp<em>.</em>A1 <br /> AlgS (C)<br /> AlgM1 (M)<br /> AlgM2 (M)<br /> AlgQ1 (R)<br /> AlgQ2 (R)</p></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top><TD COLSPAN=4 valign=top>&nbsp;</CENTER></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#99ccff"><TD><b><A NAME="3.A.1.1.11"></A><A HREF="tcprotein.php?substrate=3.A.1.1.11&tcname=">3.A.1.1.11</a></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Saturated and unsaturated oligogalacturonide transporter, TogMNAB (transports di- to tetrasaccharide pectin degradation products which consist of D-galacuronate, sometimes with 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose uronate at the reducing end of the oligosaccharide) (<span id="ref9346.11555291" class="cite">Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat <em>et al.</em> 2001</span><strong>)</strong>.

structure is available (PDB 6AN7) (<span>Bi <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>) for the Wzm-Wzt homologue from <em>Aquifex aeolicus </em>in an open conformation. The transporter forms a transmembrane channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a linear polysaccharide. Its nucleotide-binding domain and a periplasmic extension form 'gate helices' at the cytosolic and periplasmic membrane interfaces that probably serve as substrate entry and exit points (<span>Bi <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). O antigen structures are serotype specific and form extended cell surface barriers endowing many pathogens with survival benefits. In the ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, O antigens are assembled on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane on a lipid anchor and reoriented to the periplasmic leaflet by WzmWzt for ligation to the core lipopolysaccharides. This process depends on the chemical modification of the O antigen's nonreducing terminus, sensed by WzmWzt via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) that extends its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). <span id="ref34552599.33443152" class="cite">Caffalette and Zimmer 2021</span> provided the cryoEM structure of this full-length WzmWzt transporter bound to ATP in a lipid environment, revealing a highly asymmetric transporter organization. The CBDs dimerize and associate with only one NBD. Conserved loops at the CBD dimer interface straddle a conserved peripheral NBD helix. The CBD dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the NBDs and its putative ligand-binding sites face the transporter to likely modulate ATPase activity upon O antigen binding. A closed WzmWzt conformation in which an aromatic belt near the periplasmic channel exit seals the transporter in a resting, ATP-bound state. The sealed transmembrane channel is asymmetric, with one open and one closed cytosolic and periplasmic portal (<span id="ref34552599.33443152" class="cite">Caffalette and Zimmer 2021</span>).&nbsp;</p>

and stability of epithelial tissues such as the pulmonary alveoli and 
the skin. In insects, skin waterproofness depends on the outermost layer
 of the extracellular cuticle envelope that contains cuticulin, 
an unidentified water-repellent complex molecule composed of proteins, 
lipids and catecholamines. Based on live-imaging analyses of fruit fly 
larvae,&nbsp;<span id="ref34553146.29306642" class="cite">Zuber <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> found that initially, envelope units are assembled within 
putative vesicles harbouring the ABC transporter Snu and the 
extracellular protein Snsl. In a second step, the content of these 
vesicles is distributed to cuticular lipid-transporting nanotubes named 
pore canals and to the cuticle surface, dependent on Snu function. The surface of <em>snu</em> and <em>snsl</em> mutant larvae is depleted of
 lipids and cuticulin. Consequently, these animals suffer uncontrolled
 water loss and penetration of xenobiotics. The data allude to a 
two-step model of envelope (i.e. barrier) formation. The proposed 
mechanism in principle parallels the events occurring during 
differentiation of the lipid-based ECM by keratinocytes in the 
vertebrate skin, suggesting establishment of analogous mechanisms of skin
 barrier formation in vertebrates and invertebrates (<span id="ref34553146.29306642" class="cite">Zuber <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Animals</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p><a></a></p>

Four x-ray structures, trapped in different conformations, two with and two without nucleotide, have been solved (<span>Ward <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>). They suggest an alternating accessibility mode of transport with major conformational changes.&nbsp; The mechanism and conformational transitions have been discussed (<span>Moradi and Tajkhorshid 2013</span>).&nbsp; MsbA is energized both by ATP hydrolysis and the H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient (<span>Singh <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). <span>Mi <em>et al.</em> 2017</span> used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 &Aring;-resolution structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA revealed that LPS binds deeply inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet. Two sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP revealed a closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. A&nbsp; 2.9 A resolution structure of MsbA in complex with G907, a selective small-molecule antagonist with bactericidal activity, revealed an unanticipated mechanism of ABC transporter inhibition. G907 traps MsbA in an inward-facing, lipopolysaccharide-bound conformation by wedging into an architecturally conserved transmembrane pocket. A second allosteric mechanism of antagonism occurs through structural and functional uncoupling of the nucleotide-binding domains (<span>Ho <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including MsbA has been demonstrated (<span id="ref34549525.28004795" class="cite">Kaur <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>).

Two first-generation inhibitors of MsbA, TBT1 and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays, TBT1 and G247 were found to bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains (<span id="ref34553934.34554829" class="cite">Th&eacute;lot <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).

CH2 is domain-swapped within the MsbA structure, and substrate binding induces a larger response in CH2 compared to CH1.

A gating ring found in MacA may act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism (<span id=""ref34546728.28504659"" class=""cite"">Fitzpatrick <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).

MacB has a fold that is different from other structurally characterized ABC transporters and uses a unique molecular mechanism termed mechanotransmission. Unlike other bacterial ABC transporters, MacB does not transport substrates across the inner membrane in which it is based, but instead couples cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis with transmembrane conformational changes that are used to perform work in the extra-cytoplasmic space. In the MacAB-TolC tripartite pump, mechanotransmission drives efflux of antibiotics and export of a protein toxin from the periplasmic space via the TolC exit duct.

changes from one side of the <span class="highlight">membrane</span> to the other, a process termed mechanotransmission. Comparison of 
ATP-bound and nucleotide-free states revealed how reversible dimerization
 of the nucleotide binding domains drives opening and closing of the 
MacB periplasmic domains via concerted movements of the second 
transmembrane segment and the major coupling helix. They proposed that the 
assembled tripartite pump acts as a molecular bellows to propel 
substrates through the TolC exit duct, driven by MacB 
mechanotransmission. Homologs of MacB that do not form tripartite pumps,
 but share structural features underpinning mechanotransmission, include
 the LolCDE lipoprotein trafficking complex and FtsEX cell division 
signaling protein. The MacB architecture serves as a blueprint for

The structure of ligand-bound LolCDE has been solved (<span id="ref5866.17038124" class="cite">Ito <em>et al</em>., 2006</span>). LolC and LolE each have 4 TMSs (1+3). Unlike most ATP binding cassette transporters mediating the transmembrane flux of substrates, the LolCDE complex catalyzes the extrusion of lipoproteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. The LolCDE complex is unusual in that it can be purified as a liganded form, which is an intermediate of the lipoprotein release reaction (<span id="ref5939.18218629" class="cite">Taniguchi and Tokuda, 2008</span>). LolCDE has been reconstituted from separated subunits (<span id="ref5886.17509078" class="cite">Kanamaru <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>).&nbsp; LolE binds the outer membrane lipoprotein, PAL (<span id="ref34543640.23187171" class="cite">Mizutani <em>et al.</em> 2013</span>). The mechanism of LolCDE as a molecular extruder of bacterial triacylated lipoproteins has been reported (<span id="ref34553586.34344901" class="cite">Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>) who determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc-embedded LolCDE in the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound states at 3.8-&Aring; and 3.5-&Aring; resolution, respectively. The structural analyses, together with biochemical and mutagenesis studies, uncovered how LolCDE recognizes its substrate by interacting with the lipid and N-terminal peptide moieties of the lipoprotein, and identify the amide-linked acyl chain as the key element for LolCDE interaction. Upon nucleotide binding, the transmembrane helices and the periplasmic domains of LolCDE undergo large-scale, asymmetric movements, resulting in extrusion of the captured lipoprotein. Comparison of LolCDE and MacB revealed the conserved mechanism of type VII ABC transporters and emphasized the unique properties of LolCDE as a molecule extruder of triacylated lipoproteins (<span id="ref34553586.34344901" class="cite">Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).</p>

First, nucleophilic attack of an activated lytic water molecule at the ATP gamma-phosphate yields ADP + HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. A conserved glutamate located close to the gamma-phosphate transiently accepts a proton acting as a catalytic base. In the second step, the proton transfers back from the catalytic base to the gamma-phosphate, yielding ADP + H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. These two reaction steps are followed by rearrangements of the hydrogen bond network and the coordination of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. The overall free energy change of the reaction is close to zero, suggesting that ATP binding is essential for tight dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains and the transition of the transmembrane domains from inward- to outward-facing.

The type II transporter has a tightly closed transmembrane channel due to "extracellular gating" residues that prevent water permeation and ion reflux.

Mutagenesis of the extracellular gate perturbs manganese uptake, while coordination site mutagenesis abolishes import.

domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling 
helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and 
LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. 
Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity 
laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is
 expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and 
hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction
 by LptB<sub>2</sub>FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (<span id="ref34546832.28394325" class="cite"><span id="ref34546837.28394325" class="cite">Luo <em>et al.</em> 2017</span></span>). LptB2FG extracts LPS from the periplasmic face of the IM through a pair of lateral gates and then powers transperiplasmic transport to the OM through a slide formed by either of the periplasmic domains of LptF or LptG, LptC, LptA and the N-terminal domain of LptD. The structural and functional studies of the seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins provide a platform to explore the unusual mechanisms of LPS extraction, transport and insertion from the inner membrane to the outer membrane (<span id="ref34547248.28821406" class="cite">Dong <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).

Pgp also exports immunosuppressants, detergents, long-chain fatty acids, HIV protease inhibitors, synthetic tetramethylrosamine analogues, calcein M, etc.); it is also a peptide efflux pump, and peptide inhibitors have been designed (<span id="ref34550098.15916428" class="cite">Tarasova <em>et al.</em> 2005</span>). It is also a phospholipid (e.g., phosphatidyl serine), cholesterol and sterol flippase. It binds and probably transports inhibitors and agonists of SUR (3.A.1.208.4) (<a>Bessadok <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>). Modulatory effects of inhibitory amlodipine and tamoxifen on P-glycoprotein efflux activities have been studied (<span id="ref34551374.15285842" class="cite">Darvari and Boroujerdi 2004</span>).

intracellular loops of the TMSs that slot into grooves on the NBDs. The Q loops at the base of these grooves are required to couple drug binding to the ATP catalytic cycle of drug export (<span>Zolnerciks <em>et al.</em> 2014</span>). Ocotillol analogues are strong competitive inhibitors (<span>Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>).&nbsp; <span>Durmus <em>et al.</em> 2015</span> have reviewed PGP transport of cancer chemotheraputic agents.&nbsp; ABCB1 variants modulate therapeutic responses to modafinil
and may partly explain pharmacoresistance in Narcolepse type 1 (NT1) patients (<span>Moresco <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>).&nbsp; Many inhibitors have been identified (<span>Hemmer <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>).&nbsp; The open-and-close
motion of the protein alters the surface topology of P-gp within the drug-binding pocket,
explaining its polyspecificity (<span>Esser <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). The ATP- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of the mouse Pgp transporter have been defined, showing that the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is harnessed in the NBDs in a two-stroke cycle (<span>Verhalen <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).&nbsp; Rilpivirine inhibits MDR1- and BCRP-mediated efflux of abacavir and increases its transmembrane transport (<span>Reznicek <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).&nbsp; It transports Huerzine A in the brain, a drug that is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (<span>Li <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). AbcB1 acts in concert with ABCA1, ABCG2 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-&beta; 
peptide (A&beta;) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (<span>Kuai <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).The structure has been determined with&nbsp;the ABCB1 inhibitor, zosuquidar, bound.&nbsp; This structure reveals the transporter in an occluded conformation with a central, enclosed, inhibitor-binding pocket lined by residues from all TMSs. The pocket spans almost the entire width of the lipid membrane and is occupied exclusively by two closely interacting zosuquidar molecules (<span>Alam <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).&nbsp; Iit is also inhibited by dacomitinib (<span>Fan <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Moreover, <span>Kim and Chen 2018 </span>presented the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing 
conformation, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.4-&Aring; 
resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer 
occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the 
inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space 
and is compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates
 that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release (<span>Kim and Chen 2018</span>). P-gp also transports opioid peptides (<span>Ganapathy and Miyauchi 2005</span>). MDR1 has been quantified in primary human renal cell carcinoma cells and corresponding normal tissue, and down-regulation or expression loss was documented in tumor tissues, corroborating its importance in drug resistance and efficacy (<span>Poetz <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Regarding the conformational transitions, first the transition is driven by the NBDs, then transmitted to the cytoplasmic parts of TMSs, and finally to the periplasmic parts. The trajectories show that besides the translational motions, the NBDs undergo a rotation movement (<span>Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Isoxanthohumol is a substrate and competitive inhibitor which reverses ABCB1-mediated doxorubicin resistance (<span>Liu <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). Tariquidar is a potent inhibitor, even when taken orally (<span>Matzneller <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Combined oral administration of the ovarian hormones, ethinyl estradiol and progesterone, significantly lowered both MDR-1 mRNA and MDR-1 protein in the ovary (<span id="ref34549136.30460040" class="cite">Brayboy <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Its expression in immune cells plays a protective role from xenobiotics and toxins (<span id="ref34549269.30524890" class="cite">Bossennec <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Oxypeucedanin reverses P-gp-mediated drug transport by inhibition of P-gp activity and P-gp protein expression as well as downregulation of P-gp mRNA levels (<span id="ref34549292.30042338" class="cite">Dong <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).<span id="ref34549467.30765569" class="cite"> Alam <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>&nbsp;determined the 3.5-&Aring; cryo-EM
structure of substrate-bound human ABCB1 reconstituted in lipidic 
nanodiscs, revealing a single molecule of the chemotherapeutic compound 
paclitaxel (Taxol) bound in a central, occluded pocket. A second 
structure of inhibited, human-mouse chimeric ABCB1 revealed two 
molecules of zosuquidar occupying the same drug-binding pocket. Minor 
structural differences between substrate- and inhibitor-bound ABCB1 
sites are amplified toward the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), 
revealing how the plasticity of the drug-binding site controls the 
dynamics of the ATP-hydrolyzing NBDs. Ordered 
cholesterol and phospholipid molecules suggest how the membrane 
modulates the conformational changes associated with drug binding and 
transport (<span id="ref34549467.30765569" class="cite">Alam <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). The TMS4/6 cleft may be an energetically favorable entrance gate for ligand entry into the binding pocket of P-gp (<span id="ref34549656.30899446" class="cite">Xing <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). The epigallocatechin gallate derivative Y6 reverses drug resistance mediated by ABCB1 (<span id="ref34549771.30972279" class="cite">Wen <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with 
stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized 
by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites, but this 
state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity 
inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites (<span id="ref34549942.31097669" class="cite">Dastvan <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). It transports temozolomide (TMZ) which is used as a treatment of glioblasomas (<span id="ref34550415.31624332" class="cite">Malmstr&ouml;m <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Unconventional cholesterol translocation on the surface of Pgp provides a secondary transport model for the known flippase activity of ABC exporters of cholesterol (<span id="ref34550618.31676371" class="cite">Thangapandian <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). An in silico multiclass classification model capable of predicting the probability of a compound to interact with P-gp has been developed using a counter-propagation artificial neural network (CP ANN) based on a set of 2D molecular descriptors, as well as an extensive dataset of 2512 compounds (1178 P-gp inhibitors, 477 P-gp substrates and 857 P-gp non-active compounds) (<span id="ref34550673.31130601" class="cite">Mora Lagares <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>).&nbsp; Jervine is a natural teratogenic compound isolated from <em>Veratrum californicum</em>.&nbsp;<span id="ref34550873.31207578" class="cite">Liu <em>et al.</em> 2019</span> showed that jervine sensitizes the anti-proliferation effect of doxorubicin (DOX) and that the synergistic mechanism was related to the intracellular accumulation of DOX via modulating ABCB1 transport. Jervine did not affect the expression of ABCB1 in mRNA or protein levels. However, jervine increased the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and probably served as a substrate of ABCB1. Jervine binds to a closed ABCB1 conformation and blocks drug entrance to the central binding site at the transmembrane domain (<span id="ref34550873.31207578" class="cite">Liu <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). 6-Triazolyl-substituted sulfocoumarins inhibit P-gp (<span id="ref34550963.31330259" class="cite">Podolski-Renić <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). ATP binding causes the conformational change to the outward-facing state, and ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of &gamma;-phosphate from both NBDs allow the outward-facing state to return to the original inward-facing state (<span id="ref34551027.32111736" class="cite">Futamata <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>).

Homology modeling provided insight into ligand binding through molecular docking studies (<span id="ref34551767.32517082" class="cite">Mora Lagares <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Sitravatinib&nbsp; reverses MDR mediated by ABCB1 and partially antagonized ABCC10-mediated MDR (<span id="ref34551789.32525624" class="cite">Yang <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Apiole from parsley blocks the active P-gp site, with strong binding energy, which, in turn, inhibits doxorubicin and vincristine efflux, increasing the antiproliferative response of these chemotherapeutic agents (<span id="ref34552170.33096917" class="cite">Afonso de Lima <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). The mechanisms of action of synthetic, potent, small molecule P-gp inhibitors have been reviewed (<span id="ref34552236.33047304" class="cite">Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). ATP binding to the open NBDs and ATP hydrolysis in the closed NBD dimer represent two steps of energy input, each leading to the formation of a high energy state. Relaxation from these high energy states occurs through conformational changes that push ABCB1 through the transport cycle (<span id="ref34552311.32054924" class="cite">Sz&ouml;llősi <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). 14 conserved residues (seven in both TMsSs 6 and 12) were substituted with alanine and generated a mutant termed 14A (<span id="ref34552316.33168729" class="cite">Sajid <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>).

<p>The peroxysomal long chain fatty acid (LCFA) half transporter, ABCD1 (ALD, ALDP, the X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD or ALDP) protein) (functions as a homodimer and accepts acyl-CoA esters (<a>van Roermund <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>)). It transports C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids and their CoA-derivatives as substrates (<a>van Roermund <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>; <span id="ref34555681.36374178" class="cite">Jia <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).&nbsp; ABCD1 deficiency or mutation is associated with plasma and tissue elevation of C24:0 and C26:0 accompanied by demyelination and inflamation (<a>Baarine <em>et al.</em> 2012).</a>&nbsp; X-ALD is a recessive neurodegenerative disorder that
affects the brain's white matter and is associated with adrenal insufficiency. It is characterized
by abnormal function of peroxisomes, which leads to an accumulation of very long-chain fatty
acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues, especially in the cortex of the adrenal glands and the white
matter of the central nervous system, causing demyelinating disease and adrenocortical insufficiency
(Addison's disease or X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (<span>Kallabi <em>et al.</em> 2013</span>; <span>Andreoletti <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>) The system forms heterodimers with PMP70 (ABCD3; TC#3.A.1.203.1) (<span>Hillebrand <em>et al.</em> 2007</span>). X-ALD, the most common peroxisomal disorder, results from mutations in ABCD1 (ALDP) (<span>Margoni <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).&nbsp;The structure and function of the ABCD1 variant database have been described (<span id="ref34554360.35053399" class="cite">Mallack <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). This peroxisomal very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) transporter is central to fatty acid catabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Its dysfunction underlies toxic cytosolic accumulation of VLCFAs, progressive demyelination, and neurological impairment including X-ALD.&nbsp;<span id="ref34554387.35013584" class="cite">Le <em>et al.</em> 2022</span> presented cryo-EM structures of ABCD1 in phospholipid nanodiscs in a nucleotide bound conformation open to the peroxisomal lumen and an inward facing conformation open to the cytosol at up to 3.5 &Aring; resolution, revealing details of its transmembrane cavity and ATP- dependent conformational spectrum. They identified features distinguishing ABCD1 from its closest homologs and showed that coenzyme A (CoA) esters of VLCFAs modulate ABCD1 activity in a species dependent manner. A transport mechanism was suggested in which the CoA moieties of VLCFA-CoAs enter the hydrophilic transmembrane domain while the acyl chains extend out into the surrounding membrane bilayer. The structures help rationalize disease causing mutations (<span id="ref34554387.35013584" class="cite">Le <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).&nbsp;Three cryogenic EM structures of ABCD1: the apo-form, substrate- and ATP-bound forms have been solved (<span id="ref34554939.35676282" class="cite">Chen <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>). Distinct from what was seen in the previously reported ABC transporters, the two symmetric molecules of behenoyl coenzyme A (C22:0-CoA) cooperatively bind to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). For each C22:0-CoA, the hydrophilic 3'-phospho-ADP moiety of the CoA portion inserts into one TMD, with the succeeding pantothenate and cysteamine moiety crossing the inter-domain cavity, whereas the hydrophobic fatty acyl chain extends to the opposite TMD. Structural analysis combined with biochemical assays illustrated snapshots of the ABCD1-mediated substrate transport cycle (<span id="ref34554939.35676282" class="cite">Chen <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).&nbsp;<span id="ref34555681.36374178" class="cite">Jia <em>et al.</em> 2022</span> reported the cryo-EM structure of human ALDP at 3.4 &Aring; resolution. ALDP exhibits a cytosolic-facing conformation. Compared to other lipid ATP-binding cassette transporters, ALDP has two substrate binding cavities formed within the transmembrane domains. Such structural organization may be suitable for the coordination of VLCFAs. X-ALD is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, encoding a peroxisomal protein, which has various clinical manifestations and a rapid progression from initial symptoms to fatal inflammatory demyelination (<span id="ref34555728.36384734" class="cite">Yu <em>et al.</em> 2022</span>).

of the transporter (<span>Lee <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). High expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were observed in liver, the digestive tract and the mammary gland.

ABCG5/8 mediates secretion of neutral sterols into bile and the gut lumen, whereas G1 (TC# 3.A.1.204.12) transports cholesterol from macrophages to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Cryo-EM structures of human G5G8 in sterol-bound and human G1 in cholesterol- and ATP-bound states have been solved. Both transporters have a sterol-binding site that is accessible from the cytosolic leaflet. A second site is present midway through the transmembrane domains of ABCG5/G8.

selectively act as a communication link between ATP hydrolysis and drug transport (<span>Puri <em>et al.</em> 2009</span>).&nbsp; The 4 domains (2Cs and 2 Ms) are connected by intracellular loops that allow coupling between ATP hydrolysis and transport&nbsp; (<span>Shah <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>) and faciliitate membrane targetting (<span>Shah <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>). Multiple drug binding sites have been identified (<span>Nim <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). The system also transports steroid hormones such as &beta;-estradiol and corticosterone as well as rhodamine 6G using specific but overlapping binding sites (<span>Baghel <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).  The 23-membered-ring macrolide, tacrolimus, a commonly used 
immunosuppressant also known as FK506, is a broad-spectrum inhibitor 
and an efflux pump substrate, and mutations that minimize its export 
have been isolated (<span id="ref34548978.30348662" class="cite">Tanabe <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). A structural motif, called the E-helix, plays a role in the maintenance of proper structural fold and/or inter-domain contacts (<span id="ref34549302.30639597" class="cite">Vishwakarma <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>).

This transporter has an extra N-terminal domain (TMD0) and a loop, L0.&nbsp; TMD0 is not required for transport function, but L0 maintains ABCC6 in a
targeting-competent state for the basolateral membranes of liver and kidney cells and might be involved in regulating the NBDs (<span>Miglionico <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). PXE is a disease of altered
elastic properties in multiple tissues. Many of these mutations influence various steps in the
biosynthetic pathway, minimally altering local domain structure but adversely impacting ABCC6
assembly and trafficking (<span>Ran and Thibodeau 2016</span>). PXE is an ectopic, metabolic mineralization disorder that affects the skin, eye, and vessels. ABCC6 is assumed to mediate efflux of one or several small molecule compounds from the liver cytosol to the circulation. In mice, abrogating ABCC6 function causes alterations in the liver metabolic profile, suggesting that PXE is a metabolic disease originating from a liver disturbance (<span>Rasmussen <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). Thus, MRP6 is involved in the regulation of tissue calcification in mammals, and mutations are associated with human ectopic calcification disorders. Comparative analyses of ABCC6 and ABCC1 from invertebrates to vertebrates revealed a bony endoskeleton first evolved with ABCC1, while the ABCC6 gene is only found in bony vertebrate genomes (<span>Parreira <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable multi-system ectopic mineralization disorder, is caused by inactivating mutations in the ABCC6 gene. The encoded protein has a specialized efflux function in hepatocytes by contributing to plasma levels of PPi, a potent inhibitor of mineralization in soft connective tissues. Reduced plasma PPi levels underlie the ectopic mineralization in PXE (<span id="ref34554015.34597610" class="cite">Kowal <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).&nbsp; AbcC6 deficiency prevents rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (<span id="ref34557573.38057332" class="cite">Casemayou <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Animals</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>ABCC6 (MRP6) of <em>Homo sapiens</em> (O95255)</p></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top><TD COLSPAN=4 valign=top>&nbsp;</CENTER></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#99ccff"><TD><b><A NAME="3.A.1.208.11"></A><A HREF="tcprotein.php?substrate=3.A.1.208.11&tcname=">3.A.1.208.11</a></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Vacuolar metal resistance and drug detoxification protein, yeast cadmium factor (YCF1 or Ycf1p), of 1515 aas and 15 or 16 TMSs in a 5 + 6 + 4 or 5 TMS arrangement; it transports cadmium-glutathione conjugates, glutathione S-conjugated leukotriene C<sub>4</sub>, organic glutathione S-conjugates, selenodigluthatione, unconjugated bilirubin, reduced glutathione, and diazaborine (<span id="ref8207.21880115" class="cite">Lazard <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>).

Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) cause neonatal diabetes mellitus. Because mutant channels are inhibited less strongly by MgATP, this increases K(ATP) currents in pancreatic beta cells, thus reducing insulin secretion and producing diabetes (de <span>Wet <em>et al</em>., 2007</span>). Binds ligands (blockers): glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and meglitinide as well as agonists, SR47063 (a cromakalim analog), P1075 (a pinacidil analog), and diazoxide (<span>Bessadok <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>).&nbsp;ATP activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels composed of mutant sulfonylurea receptor 1 and Kir6.2 with diminished PIP2 sensitivity (<span>Pratt and Shyng, 2011</span>).&nbsp;Dominant missense mutations in ABCC9, promoting open channel formation, cause Cant&uacute; syndrome (<span>Harakalova <em>et al.</em>, 2012</span>; <span>van Bon <em>et al.</em>, 2012</span>). The N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1 controls gating of Kir6.2 by modulating channel sensitivity to PIP2 (<span>Pratt <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>). Familial mild hyperglycemia is due to the ABCC8-V84I mutation (<span>Gonsorcikova <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>). ATP regulates KATP channels by promoting dimerization and conformational switching (<span>Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2013</span>).&nbsp; Mutations causing neonatal diabetes are attributed to alterations in the affinites for ATP and ADP (<span>Ortiz and Bryan 2015</span>).&nbsp; Two groups of mutations with different cellular mechanisms have been identified. 1) Channel complexes with mutations in NBD2 of SUR1 traffic normally but are unable
to be activated by MgADP. 2) Channel mutations in the TMS domains of SUR1 are retained in
the ER and have variable functional impairment (<span>Nessa <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>). KATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR1) in the brain and endocrine
pancreas&nbsp; couple metabolic status to the membrane potential. In 
beta-cells, increases in
cytosolic [ATP/ADP] inhibit KATP channel activity, leading to membrane 
depolarization and
exocytosis of insulin granules. Mutations in ABCC8 (SUR1) or KCNJ11 
(Kir6.2) can result in gain or
loss of channel activity and cause neonatal diabetes (ND) or congenital 
hyperinsulinism (CHI),
respectively.&nbsp; Nucleotide binding without hydrolysis switches SUR1 to 
stimulatory conformations.&nbsp; Increased affinity for ATP gives rise to ND 
while decreased affinty gives rise to CHI (<span>Ortiz and Bryan 2015</span>). SUR1 mutations constitute a genetic aetiology for neonatal diabetes, and they act by reducing the K<sub>ATP </sub>channel's ATP sensitivity (<span>Proks <em>et al.</em> 2006</span>). Polymorphic ABCC8 isoforms are key regulatory proteins of cerebral oedema in many neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (<span>Jha <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). In polymorphisms predictive of oedema, variant alleles/genotypes confer increased risk while different variant polymorphisms are associated with favourable outcome, potentially suggesting distinct mechanisms (<span>Jha <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). KATP channels are energy sensors that are clinically validated drug targets. KATP inhibitors are prescribed for diabetes and KATP activators are used for the treatment of hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hair loss. Wu et al., 2022 [PMID<strong> 36253099</strong>] highlight the current knowledge about the drug binding modes observed using cryogenic EM. The inhibitors and activators bind to two distinct sites in the transmembrane domain of the SUR subunit. These drugs allosterically modulate the dimerization of SUR nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and thus KATP channel activity (Wu et al., 2022 [PMID<strong> 36253099</strong>]).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Animals</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>SUR1 of <em>Homo sapiens</em> (Q09428)</p></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top><TD COLSPAN=4 valign=top>&nbsp;</CENTER></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#99ccff"><TD><b><A NAME="3.A.1.208.40"></A><A HREF="tcprotein.php?substrate=3.A.1.208.40&tcname=">3.A.1.208.40</a></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Putative fumonisin (mycotoxin) exporter of 1489 aas and about 16 TMSs, Fum19.&nbsp; Present in an operon with fumonisin biosynthetic enzymes (<span id="ref34547247.12620260" class="cite">Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2003</span>).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>Fum19 of <em>Gibberella moniliformis </em>(Maize ear and stalk rot fungus) <em>(Fusarium verticillioides)</em></p></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top><TD COLSPAN=4 valign=top>&nbsp;</CENTER></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#99ccff"><TD><b><A NAME="3.A.1.208.41"></A><A HREF="tcprotein.php?substrate=3.A.1.208.41&tcname=">3.A.1.208.41</a></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>The antifungal agent, EchonocandinB, exporter, EcdL of 1479 aas and 16 TMSs (<span id="ref34547357.28927344" class="cite">Bera <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).</p></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>EcdL of <em>Aspergillus rugulosus</em></p></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#ffffff" valign=top><TD COLSPAN=4 valign=top>&nbsp;</CENTER></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#99ccff"><TD><b><A NAME="3.A.1.208.42"></A><A HREF="tcprotein.php?substrate=3.A.1.208.42&tcname=">3.A.1.208.42</a></TD><TD><b><font color=#3333CC><p>MRP4 ABC anthocyanin/phytic acid efflux porter of 1510 aas and 12 TMSs.&nbsp; <span>It exports anthocyanin in aleurone tissues ().&nbsp; ABC transporter that may affect phytic acid

MlaA (VacJ) is a "spreading" protein, essential for <em>Shigella&nbsp;</em>pathogenicity (<span id="ref8827.8145644" class="cite">Suzuki <em>et al.</em>, 1994</span>).&nbsp; The ABC transporter, MlaEFBD, provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of 
aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner 
membrane (IM) (<span id="ref34546663.27529189" class="cite">Thong <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). MlaD spans the periplasm, forms stable hexamers within the complex, functions in 
substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs within a channel that spans the periplasm, and modulates ATP 
hydrolytic activity. MlaB plays critical roles in both the 
assembly and activity of the transporter.&nbsp; MlaA forms a complex with OmpC and OmpF in the outer membrane to extract PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (<span id="ref34546665.26314242" class="cite">Chong <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>). MlaA is a monomeric 2 &alpha;-helical TMS OM protein that functions as a 
phospholipid translocation channel, forming a ~20-&Aring;-thick doughnut 
embedded in the inner leaflet of the OM with a central, amphipathic 
pore (<span id="ref34547597.29038444" class="cite">Abell&oacute;n-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). This architecture prevents access of inner leaflet phospholipids 
to the pore, but allows <span class="highlight">outer</span> leaflet phospholipids to bind to a pronounced ridge surrounding the 
channel. Members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family, one of which is MlaD, form hexameric 
assemblies with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport across the periplasm (<span id="ref34551573.28388411" class="cite">Ekiert <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). 
MlaD forms a ring associated with the ABC 
transporter complex in the inner membrane. A soluble lipid-binding 
protein, MlaC ferries lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein
 complex. EM structures of two other <em>E. coli</em> MCE proteins 
show that YebT (LetB) forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE 
rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB 
create channels of sufficient length to span the periplasmic space. These homologs transport lipids between the two membranes of 
Gram-negative bacteria, some eukaryotic organelles and possibly actinobacteria (<span id="ref34551573.28388411" class="cite">Ekiert <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>). MCE systems mediate phospholipid trafficking across the periplasm. ~3.5 &Aring; cryo-EM structures of the <em>E. coli</em> MCE protein 
LetB reveals an ~0.6 megadalton complex that consists of seven stacked 
rings, with a central hydrophobic tunnel sufficiently long to span the 
periplasm (<span id="ref34551574.32359438" class="cite">Isom <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Lipids bind inside the tunnel, suggesting that it functions 
as the pathway for lipid transport. Cryo-EM structures in the open and 
closed states revealed a dynamic tunnel lining with implications for 
gating and substrate translocation. These results support a model in which 
LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a
 hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the 
periplasm (<span id="ref34551574.32359438" class="cite">Isom <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). The transmembrane subunit, MlaE, has minimal sequence similarity to other transporters.&nbsp;<span id="ref34552292.33236984" class="cite">Coudray <em>et al.</em> 2020</span> reported the cryo-EM structure of MlaFEDB at 3.05 &Aring; resolution, revealing distant relationships to the LPS and MacAB transporters, as well as members of the eukaryotic ABCA/ABCG families. A continuous transport pathway extends from the MlaE substrate- binding site, through the channel of MlaD, and into the periplasm. Two phospholipids are bound to MlaFEDB, suggesting that multiple lipid substrates may be transported each cycle. The structure provides mechanistic insight into substrate recognition and transport by MlaFEDB (<span id="ref34552292.33236984" class="cite">Coudray <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>). Structures of both the <em>E. coli</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> MlaFEDB complexes have been determined by cryoEM (<span id="ref34552962.33845086" class="cite">Zhou <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>). The structures show that the MlaFEBD complex contains a total of twelve protein molecules with a stoichiometry of MlaF<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>D<sub>6</sub>, and binds a plethora of phospholipids (PLs) at different locations. In contrast to canonical ABC transporters, nucleotide binding fails to trigger significant conformational changes of both MlaFEBD and MlaFEB in the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane domains, correlated with their low ATPase activities exhibited in both detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. PLs or detergents appeared to relocate to the membrane-proximal end from the distal end of the hydrophobic tunnel formed by the MlaD hexamer in MlaFEBD upon addition of ATP, indicating that retrograde PL transport might occur in the tunnel in an ATP-dependent manner. Site-specific photocrosslinking experiment confirmed that the substrate-binding pocket in the dimeric MlaE and the MlaD hexamer are able to bind PLs in vitro, in line with the notion that the MlaFEBD complex functions as a PL transporter (<span id="ref34552962.33845086" class="cite">Zhou <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).&nbsp; Mla uses a shuttle-like mechanism to move lipids between the MlaFEDB 
inner membrane complex and the MlaA-OmpF/C OM complex, via a periplasmic
 lipid-binding protein, MlaC. MlaC binds to MlaD and MlaA (<span id="ref34556342.37100290" class="cite">MacRae <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>). They mapped the MlaC-MlaA and MlaC-MlaD protein-protein interfaces, suggesting that the MlaD and MlaA binding surfaces on MlaC overlap to a 
large extent, leading to a model in which MlaC can only bind one of 
these proteins at a time. Low-resolution cryo-EM maps of MlaC bound to MlaFEDB suggested that at least two MlaC 
molecules can bind to MlaD at once, in a conformation consistent with 
AlphaFold2 predictions (<span id="ref34556342.37100290" class="cite">MacRae <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).

FliY binds L-cystine, L-cysteine, and D-cysteine with micromolar affinities, but binding of the L- and D-enantiomers induced different conformational changes in FliY, where the L- enantiomer/SBP complex interacted more efficiently with the YecSC transporter. YecSC has low basal ATPase activity that is moderately stimulated by apo-FliY, more strongly by D-cysteine-bound FliY, and maximally by L-cysteine- or L-cystine-bound FliY (<span id="ref34551129.32144203" class="cite">Sabrialabe <em>et al.</em> 2020</span>).
