<p>Protein export is central for the survival and virulence of intracellular <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> blood stage
parasites. To reach the host cell, exported proteins cross the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and
the parasite-enclosing parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), a process that requires unfolding,
suggestive of protein translocation. Components of a proposed translocon at the PVM termed PTEX are
essential in this phase of export, but
questions have been raised about its proposed membrane pore component EXP2 for which little functional
data are available in <em>P. falciparum</em>. It is also unclear how PTEX mediates trafficking of both
soluble and&nbsp; transmembrane proteins. Taking advantage of conditionally foldable domains, <span id='ref34545381.27168322' class='cite'>Mes&eacute;n-Ram&iacute;rez <em>et al.</em> 2016</span> dissected the translocation events in the parasite periphery, showing 
that two successive
translocation steps are needed for the export of transmembrane proteins,
 one at the PPM and one at
the PVM. Depending on the length of the C-terminus of the exported
substrate, these steps occur by transient interaction of the PPM and PVM
 translocon, similar to the
situation for protein transport across&nbsp; mitochondrial membranes. 
Constructs of exported proteins remained arrested in the process of 
being translocated across
the PVM. This clogged the translocation pore, prevented the export of 
all types of exported proteins
and, as a result, inhibited parasite growth. The substrates stuck in 
translocation were found in a
complex with the proposed PTEX membrane pore component EXP2, suggesting a
 role of this protein in
translocation. These data provided evidence that EXP2 is part of a 
translocating
entity, suggesting that PTEX has translocation activity and provide a 
mechanistic framework for the
transport of soluble as well as transmembrane proteins from the parasite
 boundary into the host
cell (<span id='ref34545379.27168322' class='cite'>Mes&eacute;n-Ram&iacute;rez <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caseinolytic chaperones and proteases (Clp) belong to the AAA+ protein 
superfamily and are part of the protein quality control machinery in 
cells. <em>P. falciparum</em>, the causative 
agent of malaria, has evolved an elaborate network of Clp proteins 
including two distinct ClpB ATPases, ClpB1 and ClpB2, involved in 
different aspects of parasitic proteostasis. ClpB1 is present in the 
apicoplast, a parasite-specific and plastid-like organelle hosting 
various metabolic pathways necessary for parasite growth. ClpB2 
localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane where it drives 
protein export as core subunit of the parasite-derived protein secretion 
complex, PTEX. ClpB proteins function as unfoldases and disaggregases and 
share a common architecture consisting of four domains - a variable 
N-terminal domain that binds different protein substrates, followed by 
two highly conserved catalytic ATPase domains, and a C-terminal domain. 
<span id='ref34545380.26130467' class='cite'>AhYoung <em>et al.</em> 2015</span> reported and compared the first crystal structures of the N 
terminal domains of ClpB1 and ClpB2 and analyzed their 
molecular surfaces. Solution scattering analysis of the N domain of 
ClpB2 showed that the average solution conformation is similar to the 
crystalline structure. These structures represent the first step towards
 the characterization of these two malarial chaperones and the 
reconstitution of the entire PTEX complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> requires the <em>Plasmodium</em> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) to proliferate in human red blood
 cells. During the blood stages of malaria, several hundred 
parasite-encoded proteins are exported from the parasite into the 
cytosol of red blood cells. PTEX is the translocon for protein export 
and comprises 5 proteins: EXP2, PTEX150, PTEX88, Hsp101 and TRX2 (<span id='ref34546066.27865834' class='cite'>Hakamada <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). Among 
them, EXP2 constitutes the <span class='highlight'>transmembrane</span> pore, whereas the other components&nbsp; play roles in substrate protein unfolding or providing a driving force. <span id='ref34546066.27865834' class='cite'>Hakamada <em>et al.</em> 2016 </span>expressed and characterized the 
membrane-associated component EXP2 (one (or possibly two) N-terminal &alpha;-helical TMSs plus 6 - 8 transmembrane &beta; strands. 
EXP2 formed pores in bilayer lipid membranes with an inner pore diameter of about 3.5&nbsp;nm based on electron 
microscopy images and channel currents. The pore 
comprises approximately 10-12 EXP2 subunits (<span id='ref34546066.27865834' class='cite'>Hakamada <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). The PTEX translocon is believed to be responsible for the membrane insertion of the RhopH complex (TC# 1.A.91.1.1) into the erythrocyte membrane (<span id='ref34552581.33393463' class='cite'>Schureck <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).</p>
<p>The <em>Plasmodium</em> translocon exports proteins (PTEX) into human red blood
 cells. During the blood stages of malaria, several hundred 
parasite-encoded proteins are exported from the parasite into the 
cytosol of red blood cells. PTEX is the translocon for protein export 
and comprises 5 proteins with EXP2 constituting the transmembrane pore, whereas the 
other components may play roles in unfolding the luggage proteins 
or providing the driving force.&nbsp;<span id='ref34546066.27865834' class='cite'>Hakamada <em>et al.</em> 2017</span> expressed and characterized EXP2. Expression of EXP2 is lethal to <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em>. EXP2 forms pores in 
bilayer lipid membranes, with the inner diameter estimated to
 be approximately 3.5&nbsp;nm based on electron microscopy images and channel
 currents. From this size and the molecular mass as determined by size 
exclusion chromatography and blue native polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis, it was determined that the pore comprises approximately 
10-12 EXP2 subunit (<span id='ref34546066.27865834' class='cite'>Hakamada <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).</p>
<p><em>Plasmodium</em> exported proteins must cross the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), encasing the parasite, to access the host cell. Crossing the PVM requires protein unfolding and passage through PTEX.&nbsp;<span id='ref34550876.31164473' class='cite'>Matthews <em>et al.</em> 2019</span> provided direct evidence that heat shock protein 101 (HSP101) unfolds proteins for translocation across the PVM by creating transgenic Plasmodium parasites in which the unfoldase and translocation functions of HSP101 have become uncoupled. While these parasites can export native proteins, they are unable to translocate soluble, tightly folded reporter proteins bearing the <em>Plasmodium</em> export element (PEXEL) across the PVM into host erythrocytes. In contrast, an identical PEXEL reporter protein harboring a transmembrane domain could be exported, suggesting that a prior unfolding step occurs at the PPM. These results demonstrate that the export of parasite proteins is dependent on how these proteins are presented to the secretory pathway before they reach PTEX as well as their folded status. Accordingly, only tightly folded soluble proteins secreted into the vacuolar space, and not proteins containing transmembrane domains or the majority of erythrocyte-stage exported proteins, have an absolute requirement for the full unfoldase activity of HSP101 to be exported.</p>
<p>The <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites that cause malaria export hundreds of proteins into their host red blood cell (RBC). These exported proteins drastically alter the structural and functional properties of the RBC and play critical roles in parasite virulence and survival. To access the RBC cytoplasm, parasite proteins must pass through the <em>Plasmodium</em> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) located at the membrane interfacing the parasite and host cell. HSP101 serves to unfold protein cargo requiring translocation.Moreover, addition of a transmembrane domain to soluble cargo influences its ability to be translocated by parasites in which the HSP101 motor and unfolding activities have become uncoupled. Thus, proteins with transmembrane domains use an alternative unfolding pathway prior to PTEX to facilitate export (<span id='ref34550876.31164473' class='cite'>Matthews <em>et al.</em> 2019</span>). Although many exported proteins traverse the parasite secretory pathway as typical soluble or membrane proteins, some exported proteins that are ER-targeted by a transmembrane segment-like, internal, non-cleaved hydrophobic segment, do not integrate into the ER membrane, and form an ER-lumenal species that is a productive export intermediate (<span id='ref34556151.37000891' class='cite'>Levray <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>). Trafficking of the exported <em>Plasmodium</em> protein, Pf332, differs from that of canonical eukaryotic soluble-secreted and transmembrane proteins. Pf332 is initially ER-targeted by an internal hydrophobic sequence that unlike a signal peptide, is not proteolytically removed, and unlike a transmembrane segment, does not span the ER membrane. This represents a novel means, not seen in typical membrane proteins found in model systems, by which exported transmembrane-like proteins can be targeted and trafficked within the lumen of the secretory pathway (<span id='ref34556151.37000891' class='cite'>Levray <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).</p>

EXP2 formed pores in bilayer lipid membranes with an inner diameter of approximately 3.5&nbsp;nm. The pore

Using the EXP2 nanopore allowed&nbsp; detection of poly-L-lysine (PLL) at a single-molecule level. The EXP2 nanopore has sufficient resolution to distinguish the difference in molecular weight between two individual PLL, long PLL (MW: 30,000-70,000) and short PLL (MW: 10,000) and thus functions as a peptide-detectable nanopore (<span id="ref34553532.34411416" class="cite">Miyagi <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).
