<p>The Na-NDH enzyme complex (also called the Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR complex) from <em>Vibrio alginolyticus</em> contains noncovalently bound FAD and two covalently bound FMNs as cofactors and has one iron-sulfur center of the Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> type. Electrons from NADH are donated to the quinone pool.  The complex has six subunits which are not homologous to those of the proteins of the NDH family (TC #3.D.1).  Five of these subunits are probably integral membrane proteins.  The <em>V. harveyi</em> and <em>V. cholerae</em> enzyme complexes have also been purified and have similar properties.  Homologous subunits are encoded within the genomes of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> and several other Gram-negative marine and blood-borne bacteria (<span id='ref7052.20056102' class='cite'>Verkhovsky and Bogachev, 2010</span>).&nbsp; Additionally, two additional proteins, ApbE and NqrM (DUF539), are essential for activity. ApbE is responsible for covalent attachment of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) while NqrM is necessary for biogenesis (<span id='ref34545460.26644436' class='cite'>Kostyrko <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>).</p>
<p><span id='ref6574.19155212' class='cite'>Ju&aacute;rez <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> defined the complete sequence of redox carriers in the electrons
transfer pathway through the Na<sup>+</sup>-pumping NQR enzyme. Electrons flow from NADH to
quinone through the FAD in subunit F, the 2Fe-2S center, the FMN in
subunit C, the FMN in subunit B, and finally riboflavin. The reduction
of the FMN(C) to its anionic flavosemiquinone state is the first
Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent process, suggesting that reduction of this site is
linked to Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. During the reduction reaction, two FMNs are
transformed to their anionic flavosemiquinone in a single kinetic step.
Subsequently, FMN(C) is converted to the flavohydroquinone, accounting
for the single anionic flavosemiquinone radical in the fully reduced
enzyme. A model of the electron transfer steps in the catalytic cycle
of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR has been presented by <span id='ref6574.19155212' class='cite'>Ju&aacute;rez <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span> and <span id='ref7362.20616050' class='cite'>Ju&aacute;rez <em>et al.</em>, 2010</span>.</p>
<p>Most bacteria that exhibit the Na-NDH system contain the six subunit-encoding genes in a single operon in the same gene order: <em>nqrA-F</em>.  A is relatively hydrophilic; B, D and E are very hydrophobic; B and C contain the covalently bound flavins, linked by phosphodiester linkages, and F contains motifs for binding an FeS center, FAD and NADH (<span id='ref2336.11248198' class='cite'>H&auml;se and Barquera, 2001</span>).  The enzyme also contains riboflavin (1:1 stoichiometry) that is a neutral flavin semiquinone in the oxidized form of the enzyme and an anionic flavin semiquinone in the reduced form (<span id='ref2402.12122213' class='cite'>Barquera <em>et al</em>., 2002</span>).  The e<sup>-</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry is 1:1.  The protons required for ubiquinone reduction to ubiquinol are taken up from the cytoplasm. The large, peripheral NqrA subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR binds one molecule of ubiquinone-8 (Q(8)) (<span id='ref8080.21885438' class='cite'>Casutt <em>et al.</em>, 2011</span>).&nbsp; A mutation in NqrB (D397N) uncouples transport from electron transfer in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> (<span id='ref34543955.25486106' class='cite'>Shea <em>et al.</em> 2015</span>).</p>
<p>The membrane topologies of the six subunits of Na<sup>+</sup>-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR) from <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> have been determined by a combination of topology prediction algorithms and the construction of C-terminal fusions (<span id='ref3794.17041063' class='cite'>Duffy and Barquera, 2006</span>).  NqrA is localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. NqrB has nine transmembrane helices and residue T236, the binding site for flavin mononucleotide (FMN), resides in the cytoplasm.  NqrC consists of two transmembrane helices with the FMN binding site at residue T225 on the cytoplasmic side. NqrD and NqrE show almost mirror image topologies, each consisting of six transmembrane helices; the results for NqrD and NqrE are consistent with the topologies of <em>Escherichia coli</em> homologues YdgQ and YdgL, respectively.  The NADH, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and Fe-S center binding sites of NqrF are localized to the cytoplasm.  The determination of the topologies of these subunits provides insight into the locations of all redox cofactors localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (<span id='ref3794.17041063' class='cite'>Duffy and Barquera, 2006</span>).</p>
<p>The Na(+)-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR) from <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> is a respiratory flavo-FeS complex composed of the six subunits NqrA-F. The Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR was produced as His(6)-tagged protein by homologous expression in <em>V. cholerae</em>. The isolated complex contained near-stoichiometric amounts of non-covalently bound FAD and riboflavin, catalyzed NADH-driven Na<sup>+</sup> transport, and was inhibited by 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (<span id='ref6304.18454933' class='cite'>Tao et al., 2008</span>). EPR spectroscopy showed that Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR contained low amounts of a neutral flavosemiquinone. Reduction with NADH resulted in the formation of an anionic flavosemiquinone. Subsequent oxidation of the Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR with ubiquinone-1 or O<sub>2</sub> led to the formation of a neutral flavosemiquinone.</p>
<p>Redox titration of the electronic spectra of the prosthetic groups of 
the Na<sup>+</sup>-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR) from <em> Vibrio harveyi</em> at different pH values showed five redox transitions 
corresponding to the four flavin cofactors of the enzyme and one 
additional transition reflecting oxidoreduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (<span id='ref6918.19496622' class='cite'>Bogachev <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span>).
 The pH dependence of the measured midpoint redox potentials showed that
 the two-electron reduction of the FAD located in the NqrF subunit was 
coupled with the uptake of only one H<sup>+</sup>. The one-electron reduction of 
the neutral semiquinone of riboflavin and the formation of anion 
flavosemiquinone from the oxidized FMN bound to the NqrB subunit were 
not coupled to proton uptake. The two sequential one-electron 
reductions of the FMN residue bound to the NqrC subunit showed 
pH-independent formation of the anion radical in the first step and the 
formation of fully reduced flavin coupled to the uptake of one H<sup>+</sup> in 
the second step. All four flavins stayed in the anionic form in the 
fully reduced enzyme. None of the six redox transitions in Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR 
showed dependence of its midpoint redox potential on the concentration 
of sodium ions (<span id='ref6918.19496622' class='cite'>Bogachev <em>et al.</em>, 2009</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Na<sup>+</sup>-<span class='highlight'>NQR</span> is widely distributed among marine and 
pathogenic bacteria. It converts the energy from the oxidation of NADH 
and the reduction of quinone into an electrochemical Na<sup>+</sup>-gradient. All six constituents of the<span class='highlight'>NQR</span> complex are homologous to the six proteins of the <span class='highlight'>RNF</span> complex (3.D.6).&nbsp;<span id='ref34544344.22465856' class='cite'>Ju&aacute;rez and Barquera 2012</span> proposed that sodium pumping is coupled to the redox reactions by a novel mechanism, which operates 
at multiple sites, is indirect, and is mediated by conformational changes in
 the proteins.</p>
<p>The Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR complex consists 
of six subunits, NqrA, B, C, D, E and F. <span id='ref34543643.25471880' class='cite'>Steuber <em>et al.</em> 2014</span> presented the crystal structure of the Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR complex of <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> at 3.5&nbsp;&Aring; 
resolution. The arrangement of cofactors both at the cytoplasmic and the
 periplasmic side of the complex, together with an iron 
centre in the membrane-embedded part, revealed an electron 
transfer pathway from the NADH-oxidizing cytoplasmic NqrF subunit across
 the membrane to the periplasmic NqrC and back to the quinone reduction
 site on NqrA, located in the cytoplasm. The sodium channel is localized 
in subunit NqrB, the largest membrane subunit of the 
Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR and is structurally related to urea and ammonia transporters. 
On the basis of the structure, a mechanism of redox-driven 
Na<sup>+</sup> translocation was proposed where the change in redox state of the flavin 
mononucleotide cofactor in NqrB triggers the transport of Na<sup>+</sup> through 
the channel (<span id='ref34543643.25471880' class='cite'>Steuber <em>et al.</em> 2014</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR complex has dimensions of 87&nbsp;&Aring;&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;138&nbsp;&Aring;&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;52&nbsp;&Aring;. The transmembrane part of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR
 is formed by subunits NqrB, NqrD and NqrE, which are 
integral membrane proteins with small domains in the cytoplasm or 
periplasm.
 NqrA, NqrC and NqrF are large hydrophilic subunits with the latter two 
anchored via a single transmembrane helix in the cytoplasmic membrane. 
The hydrophilic subunits NqrA and NqrF protrude into the cytoplasm, 
whereas NqrC resides in the periplasm. NqrA, which lacks transmembrane helices, is tightly bound to NqrB, forming a complex with a large interaction surface.
 Subunits NqrD and NqrE form a central structural unit that interacts 
with NqrB on one side and the transmembrane helices of NqrC and 
NqrF on the opposed sid (<span id='ref34543643.25471880' class='cite'>Steuber <em>et al.</em> 2014</span>).</p>

may have involved functional divergence from its RNF homologue (3.D.6) following duplication of the<em> rnf </em>operon, loss of the <em>rnfB </em>gene and the recruitment of the reductase subunit of an aromatic monooxygenase.&nbsp; Two additional proteins, ApbE and NqrM (DUF539), are essential for 
activity. ApbE is responsible for covalent attachment of flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN) while NqrM (D0WX40) is necessary for biogenesis (<a class="reflink" href="../../search/result.php?tc=3.D.5#ref34545460">Kostyrko <em>et al.</em> 2016</a>).&nbsp; NqrM has an N-terminal TMS and four cysteyl residues that are essential for full activity (<span id="ref34545460.26644436" class="cite">Kostyrko <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>).

In <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, the mechanism of the homologous system involves conformational coupling of redox-driven Na<sup>+</sup>-translocation has been studied (<span id="ref34557887.37710014" class="cite">Hau <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).&nbsp; Ion pumping in Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR
 is driven by large conformational changes coupling electron transfer to
 ion translocation. We have determined a series of cryo-EM and X-ray 
structures of the Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR that represent snapshots of the catalytic cycle. The six subunits NqrA, B, C, D, E, and F of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR
 harbor a unique set of cofactors that shuttle the electrons from NADH 
twice across the membrane to quinone. The redox state of a unique 
intramembranous [2Fe-2S] cluster orchestrates the movements of subunit 
NqrC, which acts as an electron transfer switch. The authors propose that this 
switching movement controls the release of Na<sup>+</sup> from a binding site localized in subunit NqrB (<span id="ref34557887.37710014" class="cite">Hau <em>et al.</em> 2023</span>).</p>
