<p>Extracellular electron transfer (EET) describes microbial 
bioelectrochemical processes in which electrons are transferred from the
 cytosol to the exterior of the cell<sup> </sup>or vice versa. Mineral-respiring Gram-negaive bacteria use elaborate haem-based electron transfer mechanisms (see TC#s 5.B.8 and 5.B.9).&nbsp;<span id='ref34549341.30209391' class='cite'>Light <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> showed that the food-borne pathogen, <em>Listeria 
monocytogenes</em>, uses a flavin-based EET mechanism to deliver 
electrons to extracellular iron or an electrode. By performing a forward genetic 
screen to identify <em>L. monocytogenes</em> mutants with diminished 
extracellular ferric iron reductase activity, an 
eight-gene locus was identified that is responsible for EET. This locus encodes a 
specialized cytoplasmic NADH dehydrogenase that segregates EET from aerobic 
respiration by channelling electrons to a discrete membrane-localized 
quinone pool. Other proteins facilitate the assembly of an
extracellular flavoprotein that, in conjunction with free-molecule 
flavin shuttles, mediates electron transfer to extracellular acceptors such as Fe<sup>3+</sup>. 
This system thus establishes a simple electron conduit that is 
compatible with the single-membrane&nbsp;structure of the Gram-positive cell.
 Activation of EET supports growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, 
and an EET mutant exhibited a competitive defect within the mouse 
gastrointestinal tract. Orthologues of the genes responsible for EET are
 present in hundreds of species across the Firmicutes phylum, including 
multiple pathogens and commensal members of the intestinal microbiota, 
and correlate with EET activity in assayed strains (<span id='ref34549344.30209391' class='cite'>Light <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). In fact, EET is probably associated with half of all bacteria, and the process requires extracytoplasmic flavinylation by AbpE, a&nbsp; mediator of extracytosolic electron transfer (<span id='ref34553329.34032212' class='cite'>M&eacute;heust <em>et al.</em> 2021</span>).</p>
<p>Type II NADH dehydrogenase&mdash;or Ndh1 in <em>L. monocytogenes</em>&mdash;catalyses 
electron exchange from cytosolic NADH to a lipid-soluble quinone 
derivative, which is the first step in the respiratory electron 
transport chain.
 Ndh2, which is encoded by&nbsp;one of the genes in the EET locus, is&nbsp;a 
protein with an N-terminal type II NADH dehydrogenase domain and a 
unique transmembrane C-terminal domain that is absent from functionally 
characterized enzymes. Consistent with&nbsp;Ndh2 being a novel NADH dehydrogenase, <span id='ref34549344.30209391' class='cite'>Light <em>et al.</em> 2018</span> observed that EET activation correlated with cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels.
 Furthermore, the proteins DmkA and DmkB&mdash;which are encoded by two other 
genes in the EET locus&mdash;are paralogues of the highly conserved microbial 
enzymes MenA and HepT, which catalyse terminal steps in the production 
of the quinone demethylmenaquinone. In <em>Escherichia coli</em>,
 three different quinones&mdash;demethylmenaquinone, menaquinone and 
ubiquinone&mdash;are used to selectively channel electrons to different 
electron acceptors. Thus, a distinct quinone derivative and NADH 
dehydrogenase functionally segregate electron fluxes for EET and 
aerobic respiration (<span id='ref34549344.30209391' class='cite'>Light <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>).</p><BR></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=5><a name="references"></a>&nbsp;<p><B>References:</B><P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=5>Light, S.H., L.
