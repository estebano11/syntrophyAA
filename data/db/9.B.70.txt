<p><span style='font-family: Times;'><strong> </strong> </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: Times;'> The SpoIIIAA-AH operon encodes 8 proteins, all of which are required for activation of sigma G during spore development in <em>Bacillus subtilis.</em> Mutations in any one of these genes blocks sporulation.  This operon is transcribed from a sigma E promoter in the mother cell after asymmetric cell division.  SpoIIIAH is known to have a single N-terminal TMS with the remainder of the proteins facing outward.  It interacts with SpoIIQ which is present on the forespore cell surface.  These two proteins possibly function as a 'zipper' to facilitate engulfment (<span id='ref3345.15574594' class='cite'>Blaylock <em>et al</em>., 2004</span>).  The other proteins may serve as a protein export system with SpoIIIAA serving as the ATPase and SpoIIIAE serving as the substrate protein. SpoIIIAA is an ATPase with Walker A and B motifs, both of which are essential for sporulation.  Residues 97-246 show weak similarity to residues 252-404 of FtsY (TC #3.A.5.1.1), the bacterial equivalent of the SRP receptor subunit.  It also shows similarity in the Walker A (GX<sub>4</sub>GKT) and B (Hy<sub>4</sub>DE) motifs with the ABC proteins of the ABC superfamily (TC #3.A.1.14.2 and #3.A.1.4.1, respectively).  SpoIIIAA is a member of the triple A or VirB11 family. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: Times;'> SpoIIIAE is a 405 aa protein with 7 putative TMSs.  It appears to have an N-terminal Sec-type signal peptide followed by TMSs 2-7.  Residues 200-350 appear to show very limited sequence similarity with many transport proteins from different families.  These include: 2.A.23.1.4 (CPA1); 9.A.15.1.1(YhaG); 3.A.7.1.1. (VirB6); 2.A.31.3.2 (AE); 3.A.1.1.14 (AraH in ABC); 2.A.52.1.4 (NiCoT); 2.A.6.2.15 (RND) and 4.A.1.2.4 (Tre(Glc-PTS)).  The significance of these observations is not known.  These regions in SpoIIIAE and the other transporters generally show 2 TMSs, a hydrophilic loop of ~50 aas, and 2 more TMSs.  SpoIIIAE may possibly be exported from the mother cell via the SpoIIIA exporter and inserted into the forespore membrane where it might function as a small molecule permease to promote sigma G-activation.  All other constituents of the system have 1-3 TMS   (see below)                                                 and may form part of the export system. </span>Based on the similarity of SpoIIIAH to a component of type III secretion systems, Camp and Losick (<span id='ref5273.18485064' class='cite'>2008</span>) have suggested that signalling is mediated by a channel that links the mother cell to the forespore.</p>
<p>At an early stage during <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> endospore development, the
bacterium divides asymmetrically to produce two daughter cells. The
smaller cell (forespore) differentiates into the endospore, while the
larger cell (mother cell) becomes a terminally differentiated cell that
nurtures the developing forespore. During development the mother cell
engulfs the forespore to produce a protoplast, surrounded by two
bilayer membranes, which separate it from the cytoplasm of the mother
cell. The activation of &sigma;<sup>G</sup>, which drives late gene expression in
the forespore, follows forespore engulfment and requires expression of
the spoIIIA locus in the mother cell. One of the spoIIIA-encoded
proteins SpoIIIAH is targeted specifically to the membrane surrounding
the forespore, through an interaction of its C-terminal extracellular
domain with the C-terminal extracellular domain of the forespore
membrane protein SpoIIQ (P71044). <span id='ref6543.18812514' class='cite'>Meisner <em>et al.</em>, 2008</span> identified a homologous relationship
between the C-terminal domain of SpoIIIAH and the YscJ/FliF protein
family, members of which form multimeric rings involved in type III
secretion systems and flagella. If SpoIIIAH forms a similar ring
structure, it may also form a channel between the mother cell and
forespore membranes. To test this hypothesis <span id='ref6543.18812514' class='cite'>Meisner <em>et al.</em>, 2008</span> developed a
compartmentalized biotinylation assay, which they used to show that the
C-terminal extracellular domain of SpoIIIAH is accessible to enzymatic
modification from the forespore cytoplasm. These and other results led them to suggest that SpoIIIAH forms part of a channel between the
forespore and mother cell that is required for the activation of &sigma;<sup>G</sup>.</p>
<p>Sporulating <em>Bacillus <span class='highlight'>subtilis</span></em> cells assemble a multimeric membrane complex connecting the mother cell
 and developing spore that is required to maintain forespore 
differentiation (<span id='ref34547424.27381174' class='cite'>Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2016</span>). An early step in the assembly of this transenvelope 
complex (called the A-Q complex) is an interaction between the 
extracellular domains of the forespore membrane protein <span class='highlight'>SpoIIQ</span> and the mother cell membrane protein SpoIIIAH. This interaction 
provides a platform onto which the remaining components of the complex 
assemble and also functions as an anchor for cell-cell signalling and 
morphogenetic proteins involved in spore development. <span class='highlight'>SpoIIQ</span> is required to recruit SpoIIIAH to the sporulation septum on the mother cell side. <span id='ref34547424.27381174' class='cite'>Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2016 </span>identified GerM, a lipoprotein previously
 implicated in spore germination, as the missing factor required for <span class='highlight'>SpoIIQ</span> localization. GerM and SpoIIIAH, derived from the mother cell, and <span class='highlight'>SpoIIQ</span>,
 from the forespore, have reciprocal localization dependencies 
suggesting they constitute a tripartite platform for the assembly of the
 A-Q complex and a hub for the localization of mother cell and forespore
 proteins.</p>
<p>During engulfment, an essential channel, the so-called 
feeding tube apparatus, crosses both membranes to create a 
direct conduit between the mother cell and the forespore. At least nine 
proteins are required to create this channel, including <span class='highlight'>SpoIIQ</span> and SpoIIIAA-AH.&nbsp;<span id='ref34547423.28784753' class='cite'>Zeytuni <em>et al.</em> 2017</span> presented the near-atomic resolution structure 
of SpoIIIAG, determined by single-particle 
cryo-EM. A 3D reconstruction revealed that SpoIIIAG assembles into a 
large and stable 30-fold symmetric complex with a mushroom-like 
architecture. The complex is collectively composed of three distinctive 
circular structures: a 60-stranded vertical &beta;-barrel that forms a large 
inner channel encircled by two concentric rings, one &beta;-mediated and the 
other formed by repeats of a ring-building motif (RBM), common to the 
architecture of various dual membrane secretion systems of distinct 
function. The&nbsp; structure shows that 
SpoIIIAG exhibits a dramatic adaptation of the RBM fold with a &beta;-triangle insertion that assembles into the prominent channel, 
the dimensions of which suggest the potential passage of large 
macromolecules between the mother cell and forespore during the feeding 
process. Indeed, mutation of residues located at key interfaces between 
monomers of this RBM resulted in severe defects both in vivo and in 
vitro (<span id='ref34547423.28784753' class='cite'>Zeytuni <em>et al.</em> 2017</span>).</p>
