3.E.1.1.1	"Bacteriorhodopsin. Proton efflux occurs via a transient linear water-molecule chain in a hydrophobic section of the Brho channel between Asp96 and Asp85 (Freier et al., 2011). Local-global conformational coupling in brho has been proposed as a transport mechanism from crystal structures of the nine states in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle (Lanyi and Schobert 2004). The protein can be converted into a chloride uptake pump by a single amino acid substitution at position 85.  However, halorhodopsin (3.E.1.2.1), which pumps chloride ions (Cl-) into the cell, apparently does not use hydrogen-bonded water molecules for Cl- transport (Muroda et al. 2012).  Nango et al. 2016 used time-resolved serial femtosecond 
crystallography and an x-ray free electron laser to visualize 
conformational changes in bRho from nanoseconds to milliseconds following 
photoactivation. An initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a 
conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic
 side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the 
extracellular side. The resulting cascade of structural changes 
throughout the protein shows how motions are choreographed as bRho 
transports protons uphill against a transmembrane concentration 
gradient. Nango et al. 2016 have created a 3-d movie of structural changes in the protein showing that an initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan 
residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein 
while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. Brho has light-independent lipid scramblase activity (Verchère et al. 2017). This activity occurs  at a rate >10,000 per trimer per second, comparable to that of other scramblases including bovine rhodopsin and fungal TMEM16 proteins. BR scrambles fluorescent analogues of common phospholipids but does not transport a glycosylated diphosphate isoprenoid lipid. In silico analyses suggested that membrane-exposed polar residues in transmembrane helices 1 and 2 of BR may provide the molecular basis for lipid translocation by coordinating the polar head-groups of transiting phospholipids. Consistent with this possibility, extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a BR trimer in a phospholipid membrane revealed water penetration along transmembrane helix 1 with the cooperation of a polar residue (Y147 in transmembrane helix 5) in the adjacent protomer. These findings suggest that the lipid translocation pathway may lie at or near the interface of the protomers of the BR trimer (Verchère et al. 2017). Retinal isomerization has been observed in the using a femtosecond x-ray laser (Nogly et al. 2018). S-TGA-1, a halobacterium-derived glycolipid, has the highest specificity to bRho, with a nanomolar dissociation constant (Inada et al. 2019). Weinert et al. 2019 recorded the structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin over 200 milliseconds in time. The snapshot from the 
first 5 milliseconds after photoactivation shows structural changes 
associated with proton release. From 10 to 15 milliseconds onwards, large additional structural rearrangements, up to 9 Å on
 the cytoplasmic side. Rotation of leucine-93 and phenylalanine-219 
opens a hydrophobic barrier, leading to the formation of a water chain 
connecting the intracellular aspartic acid-96 with the retinal Schiff 
base. The formation of this proton wire recharges the membrane pump with
 a proton for the next cycle (Weinert et al. 2019).  The effect of membrane composition on the orientation and activity of bR has been reported (Palanco et al. 2017).  Efficient transfer of bRho from native membranes to covalently circularized nanodiscs has been accomplished (Yeh et al. 2018). The oligomeric status of BRho plays a role in the photocycle associated with short-range processes, such as retinal isomerization and deprotonation of the protonated Schiff base at the retinal pocket (Kao et al. 2019). Functional bacteriorhodopsin is efficiently solubilized and delivered to membranes by the chaperonin, GroEL (Deaton et al. 2004). Thirty one unfolded bR states in the presence of the retinal chromophore have been identified during denaturation (Jacobson et al. 2020). A transient protonic capacitor explains the bacteriorhodopsin membrane experiment of Heberle et al. 1994. Thus, after proton release by an integral membrane protein, long-range proton transfer along the membrane surface is faster than proton exchange with the bulk water phase  as predicted by the TELP theory (Lee 2023). The head groups and alkyl chains of phospholipids are essential for boundary lipids and greatly influence the biological function of bRho (Umegawa et al. 2023)."	Archaea
3.E.1.1.10	Schizorhodopsin of 202 aas and 7 TMSs. The crystal structure reveals the mechanism of inward proton pumping (Higuchi et al. 2021). Schizorhodopsins (SzRs), a new rhodopsin family identified in Asgard archaea, are phylogenetically located at an intermediate position between type-1 microbial rhodopsins and heliorhodopsins. SzRs work as light-driven inward H+ pumps (Higuchi et al. 2021). Strongly hydrogen-bonded Schiff base and adjoining polyene twisting in the retinal chromophore of schizorhodopsins has been observed (Shionoya et al. 2021).	Szr of Candidatus Lokiarchaeota archaeon

Thus, a  comprehensive function-structure study of the light-driven bacterial inward proton pump, xenorhodopsin from Bacillus coahuilensis, in all major proton-conducting states was carried out (Kovalev et al. 2023). The structures revealed that proton translocation is based on proton wires regulated by internal gates. The wires serve as both selectivity filters and the translocation pathways for protons. The cumulative results suggest a general concept of proton translocation. Kovalev et al. 2023 demonstrated the use of serial time-resolved crystallography at a synchrotron source with sub-millisecond resolution for rhodopsin studies, opening the door for principally new applications.

3.E.1.1.14	Synechocystis halorhodopsin of 234 aas and 7 TMSs.  The 3-D structure is known (Astashkin et al. 2022). MRs can pump various monovalent ions like Na+, K+, Cl-, I-, and NO3-. The only characterized MR proposed to pump sulfate in addition to halides belongs to the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 7509 and is named Synechocystis halorhodopsin (SyHR).  Astashkin et al. 2022 presented the crystal structure of SyHR in the ground state, the structure of its sulfate-bound form as well as two photoreaction intermediates, the K and O states. The data reveal the molecular origin of the unique properties of the protein (exceptionally strong chloride binding and proposed pumping of divalent anions) and sheds light on the mechanism of anion release and uptake in cyanobacterial halorhodopsins. The unique properties of SyHR highlight its potential as an optogenetics tool and may help engineer different types of anion pumps with applications in optogenetics (Astashkin et al. 2022).

Structures of the archaerhodopsin-3 transporter reveal that disordering of internal water networks underpins receptor sensitization (Bada Juarez et al. 2021). Opsin-based transmembrane voltage sensors (OTVSs) are membrane proteins increasingly used in optogenetic applications to measure voltage changes across cellular membranes (Mei et al. 2021).  Khangholi et al. 2021 studied photoactivation of cell-free expressed archaerhodopsin-3 in a model cell membrane and concluded that it functions as a channel with open and closed states and a pore radius of 0.3 nm.

photochromic sensor that interacts with a soluble 14-kDa cytoplasmic transducer that is encoded on
the same operon, interconverts between all-trans-15-anti and 13-cis-15-syn
retinal forms depending on the wavelength of illumination, although only the former participates in
a photocycle with a signaling M intermediate (Dong et al. 2016). A mutation in the cytoplasmic half-channel of the
protein, replacing Asp217 with Glu (D217E), results in the creation of a light-driven, single-
photon, inward proton transporter. Dong et al. 2016 presented the 2.3 A structure of dark-adapted D217E ASR, which
reveals changes in the water network surrounding Glu217, as well as a shift in the

Although R. xylanophilus rhodopsin (RxR) is from an Actinobacterium, it is located between eukaryotic and archaeal rhodopsins in the phylogenetic tree (Kanehara et al. 2017). E. coli cells expressing RxR showed a light-induced decrease in environmental pH and inhibition by a protonophore, indicating that it works as a light-driven outward proton pump. Purified RxR has an absorption maximum at 541 nm and binds all-trans retinal. The pKa values for the protonated retinal Schiff base and its counterion were 10.7 and 1.3, respectively. Of note, RxR showed an extremely high thermal stability in comparison with other proton pumping rhodopsins such as thermophilic rhodopsin TR (by 16-times) and bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarum (HsBR, by 4-times) (Kanehara et al. 2017).

light-induced opening of proton channels to modulate cell physiology 
depending on light intensity variations. It could therefore be a sensory

Its Na+-pumping activity is greater than that of the known Na+-pumping rhodopsin, KR2. Its photochemical properties included: (i) Visible spectroscopy and HPLC revealed that BeNaR had an absorption maximum at 524 nm with predominantly (>96%) the all-trans retinal conformer. (ii) Time-dependent thermal denaturation experiments revealed that BeNaR showed high thermal stability. (iii) The time-resolved flash-photolysis in the nanosecond to millisecond time domains revealed the presence of four kinetically distinctive photointermediates, K, L, M and O.

3.E.1.6.7	"Na+ or H+ pumping bacteriorhodopsin, NaR, Kr2 or KR2 (Krokinobacter rhodopsin 2), of 280 aas and 7 TMSs.  It uses light to pump protons or sodium ions from the cell depending on the ionic composition
of the medium. In cells suspended in a KCl solution, NaR functions as a light-driven proton pump,
whereas in a NaCl solution, it exhibits light-driven sodium ion pumping, a novel activity within
the rhodopsin family (da Silva et al. 2015).  A cation switch controls its conformations, and specific interactions of Na+ with the half-channels open an
appropriate path for ion translocation (da Silva et al. 2015). Several high resolution x-ray structures have been solved (4XTO, Kato et al. 2015). Putative Na+ binding sites have been identified, and it was shown how protonation and 
conformational changes gate the ion through these sites toward the 
extracellular side (Suomivuori et al. 2017). Evidence for homology of this and other microbial rhodopsin with GPCR receptors including mamalian rhodopsins has been presented (Yee et al. 2013; Shalaeva et al. 2015). The 3-d structures have been determined by different groups (3X3B_A,B, 4XT0_A-E; 5JRF_A, and 6RF4_A-E). A covalent bond between Lys-255 and the polypeptide chain is responsible for stable retinal chromophore binding and sodium-pumping activity of KR2,but not for transport activity (Ochiai et al. 2023). Light-driven Na+-pumping rhodopsin (NaR) has been reviewed with an overview of structural and functional studies encompassing ground/intermediate-state structures and photocycle kinetics (Yang and Chen 2023). The review focuses on (1) unraveling the translocation pathway of Na+; (2) examining the role of structural changes within the photocycle, particularly in the O state, in facilitating Na+ transport; and (3) investigating the timing of Na+ uptake/release."

The x-ray crystal structure revealed the presence of a putative binding site for a
carotenoid antenna and a larger number of hydrophobic residues and aromatic-aromatic interactions than in most microbial rhodopsins (Tsukamoto et al. 2016). The structural changes upon thermal
stimulation involved a thermally induced structure in which an increase of hydrophobic interactions
in the extracellular domain, the movement of extracellular domains, the formation of a hydrogen
bond, and the tilting of transmembrane helices were observed. An extracellular LPGG motif between helices F and G may play an important
role in thermal stability, acting as a ""thermal sensor"" (Tsukamoto et al. 2016)."	Bacteriorhodopsin of Thermus thermophilus

3.E.1.7.1	Channelrhodopsin-1 (chlamyrhodopsin-3) (ChR1; Cop3; CSOA) (light-gated cation (H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+) channel) (Nagel et al., 2003). TMSs 1 and 2 are the main structures involved in desensitization involving the stabilization of the protein's conformation and the alteration of the charge distribution around the retinal-Schiff base (Zamani et al. 2017).  Replacing the glutamate located at the central gate of the ion channel with positively charged amino acyl residues reverses the ion selectivity and allows anion (chloride, Cl-) conduction (Zhang et al. 2019).  zlight-gated channelrhodopsin sparks proton-induced calcium release in guard cells (Huang et al. 2023).

3.E.1.7.10	Kalium (potassium) channelrhodoopsin 1, KCR1, of 265 aas and 7 TMSs.  It shows higher selectivity for K+ than for Na+ and therefore is used to silence neurons with light (optogenetics). Replacement of the conserved cysteine residue in the TMS 3 (Cys110) with alanine or threonine results in a >1,000-fold decrease in the channel closing rate (Sineshchekov et al. 2023).	KCR1 of Hyphochytrium catenoides
3.E.1.7.11	ChRmine of 318 aas and 7 TMSs. It is a pump-like cation-conducting channelrhodopsin that exhibits puzzling properties (large photocurrents, red-shifted spectrum, and extreme light sensitivity) that have created new opportunities in optogenetics. ChRmine and its homologs function as ion channels but, by primary sequence, more closely resemble ion pump rhodopsins; Kishi et al. 2022 presented the 2.0 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of ChRmine, revealing architectural features atypical for channelrhodopsins: trimeric assembly, a short transmembrane-helix 3, a twisting extracellular-loop 1, large vestibules within the monomer, and an opening at the trimer interface. The authors applied this structure to design three proteins (rsChRmine and hsChRmine, conferring further red-shifted and high-speed properties, respectively, and frChRmine, combining faster and more red-shifted performance) suitable for fundamental neuroscience opportunities (Kishi et al. 2022).	ChRmine of Tiarina fusa
3.E.1.7.2	"Channelrhodopsin-2 (chlamyrhodopsin-4 of 737 aas and 7 N-terminal TMSs; ChR2; CR2; Cop4; CSOB) (light-gated cation-selective ion channel (both monovalent and divalent cations (H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+) are transported)) (Nagel et al., 2003). Berndt et al. (2010) showed that ChR2 has two open states with differing ion selectivities. The channel is fairly nonspecific at the beginning of a light pulse, and becomes more specific for protons during longer periods of light exposure. Residues involved in channel closure have been identified (Bamann et al. 2010).  ChR2 is 712 aas long; the MR domain is N-terminal (Lee et al. 2015). The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state (Adam and Bondar 2018).
   Blue light illumination of ChR2 activates an intrinsic leak channel conductive for cations. Sequence comparison of ChR2 with the related ChR1 protein revealed a cluster of charged amino acids within the predicted transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), which includes glutamates E90, E97 and E101. Charge inversion substitutions altered ChR2 function, replacement of E90 by lysine or alanine resulted in differential effects on H+- and Na+-mediated currents. These results are consistent with this glutamate side chain within TMS2 contributing to ion flux through and the cation selectivity of ChR2 (Ruffert et al., 2011). Glutamate residue-97 lies in the outer pore where it interacts with a cation to facilitate dehydration. This residue is also the primary binding target of Gd3+(Tanimoto et al., 2012).  Channelrhodopsin has been converted into a light-gated chloride channel (Wietek et al. 2014).  TMSs 2, 6 and 7 reorient or rearrange during the photocycle with no major differences near TMSs 3 and 4 at the dimer
interface. TMS2 plays a key role in light-induced channel opening and
closing in ChR2 (Müller et al. 2015).  Negative charges at the extracellular side of transmembrane
domain 7 funnel cations into the pore (Richards and Dempski 2015).  CrChR2, is the most widely used optogenetic tool in neuroscience.  Water efflux and the cessation of the ion conductance are synchronized (Lórenz-Fonfría et al. 2015).  light and pH induce changes in the structure and accessibility of TMSB (Volz et al. 2016). Residues V86, K93 and N258 form a putative barrier to ion translocation. These residues contribute to cation selectivity (V86 and N258), the
transition between the two open states (V86), open channel stability, and the hydrogen-bonding
network (K93I and K93N) (Richards and Dempski 2017). The x-ray structure is available and reveals much about the mechanism of channel regulation (Gerwert 2017; Volkov et al. 2017). The mechanism of formation of the ion channel of ChR2 has been studed by molecular dynamics simulation and steering (Yang et al. 2019). The effects on ion channel activities of different protonation states of E90 in channelrhodopsin-2 have been described (Cheng et al. 2021). Yang et al. 2023 have designed a  TRP-like biohybrid sensor by integrating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) and optogenetically engineered cells on a graphene transistor for infrared sensing and imaging. They used UCNP and ChR2 within the sensor in place of TRPs. (Yang et al. 2023). Light activation of ChR2 augments an influx of Na+ with a consequent 
inhibition of cell growth. In a K+ uptake deficient yeast strain, growth
 can be rescued in selective medium by the blue light induced K+ conductance of ChR (Höler et al. 2023)."	Algae
3.E.1.7.3	Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) of light-gated ion channel. A 6 Å projection map is available (Müller et al., 2011). Glutamate residue-97 lies in the outer pore where it interacts with a cation to facilitate dehydration. This residue is also the primary binding target of Gd3+ (Tanimoto et al., 2012). Cardiomyocytes expressing ChR2 upon optical stimulation depolarize, resulting from alterations of membrane voltage and intracellular calcium (Keshmiri Neghab et al. 2021).

3.E.1.7.4	Channelopsin, MChR1 (Govorunova et al., 2011). In another channelrhodopsin (CrChR2) of this family, an E97A mutation in TMS 2 prevents high affiinity binding of the inhibitor, Gd3+ and interfers with photocurrent, but this ChR1 with an alanine at this position, has low affininty for Gd3+ but normal photocurrent (Watanabe et al. 2016).	Plants
3.E.1.7.5	Channel rhodopsin of 829 aas and 7 N-terminal TMSs, KnChR.  Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated cation (H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+) channels extensively applied as optogenetics tools for manipulating neuronal activity. All ChRs have a large cytoplasmic domain. The cation channel properties of KnChR from a filamentous terrestrial alga, Klebsormidium nitens, have been described (Tashiro et al. 2021). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain has a peptidoglycan binding domain (FimV), and modulates the ion channel properties. The channel closure rate is affected by the C-terminus moiety, and truncation of the moiety to various lengths prolongs the channel open lifetime by more than 10-fold. Two Arginine residues (R287 and R291) are crucial for altering the photocurrent kinetics. Tashiro et al. 2021 proposed that electrostatic interaction between the rhodopsin domain and the C-terminal domain accelerates the channel kinetics. Maximal sensitivity was observed at 430 and 460 nm, the former making KnChR one of the most blue-shifted ChRs, serving as a novel prototype for studying the molecular mechanism of color tuning of the ChRs.

3.E.1.7.8	Light-activated cation selective ion channel [synthetic construct] of 344 aas and 7 probable TMSs. It is also called ComV1 or Ex3mV1Co. Channelrhodopsins have been utilized in gene therapy to restore vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (Hatakeyama et al. 2023). Channel kinetics (tauon and tauoff) were considerably altered by the replacement of the 172nd amino acid and was dependent on the amino acid characteristics. The size of amino acids at this position correlated with tauon and decay, whereas the solubility correlated with tauon and tauoff. Molecular dynamic simulation indicated that the ion tunnel constructed by H172, E121, and R306 widened due to H172A variant, whereas the interaction between A172 and the surrounding amino acids weakened compared with H172. The bottleneck radius of the ion gate constructed with the 172nd amino acid affected the photocurrent and channel kinetics. The 172nd amino acid in ComV1 is a key residue for determining channel kinetics as its properties alter the radius of the ion gate (Hatakeyama et al. 2023).	ComsV1, synthetic construct

3.E.1.8.1	Anion-specific light-gated channel rhodopsin of 438 aas, Acr1, lacking measurable cation transport capability (Govorunova et al. 2015). The crystal structure of the light-gated anion channel, GtACR1, revealed a continuous tunnel traversing the protein from extracellular to intracellular sides (Li et al. 2021). The tunnel is the conductance channel closed by three constrictions: C1 in the extracellular half, mid-membrane C2 containing the photoactive site, and C3 on the cytoplasmic side. The crystal structure of bromide-bound GtACR1 revealed structural changes that relax the C1 and C3 constrictions, including a novel salt-bridge switch mechanism involving C1 and the photoactive site. Thus, substrate binding induces a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark that facilitates channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions. The results provide direct evidence that the tunnel is the closed form of the channel of GtACR1 and shed light on the light-gated channel activation mechanism (Li et al. 2021).  The preferential transport of NO3- by full-length Guillardia theta anion channelrhodopsin 1, ACR1, is enhanced by its extended cytoplasmic domain (Ohki et al. 2023).

1.A.8.10.1	Tonoplast intrinsic protein, TIPA or Tip3.1, of 268 aas and 6 TMSs.  Phylogenetic distribution, structure, transport dynamics, gating mechanism, sub-cellular localization, tissue-specific expression, and co-expression of TIPs have been reviewed to define their versatile role in plants (Sudhakaran et al. 2021). Based on the phylogenetic distribution, TIPs are classified into five distinct groups with aromatic-arginine (Ar/R) selectivity filters, typical pore-morphology, and tissue-specific gene expression patterns. The tissue-specific expression of TIPs is conserved among diverse plant species, especially for TIP3s, which are expressed exclusively in seeds. The solute specificities of TIPs plays a role in physiological processes like stomatal movement and vacuolar sequestration as well as in alleviating environmental stress. TIPs also play a role in growth and developmental processes like radicle protrusion, anther dehiscence, seed germination, cell elongation, and expansion. The gating mechanism of TIPs regulates the solute flow in response to external signals, which helps to maintain the physiological functions of the cell (Sudhakaran et al. 2021).	Plants

Cholesterol, via sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, activates or represses genes involved in its hepatic biosynthetic pathway, and also modulates the expression of hepatocyte mitochondrial aquaporin-8 (mtAQP8), a channel that can function as peroxiporin by facilitating the transmembrane diffusion of H2O2. The peroxiporin, mtAQP8, plays a role in the SREBP-controlled hepatocyte cholesterogenesis (Danielli et al. 2019). Aquaporin-8 is important for cytokine-mediated toxicity in rat insulin-producing cells (Krüger et al. 2021).  Aquaporin-8 ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the farnesoid X receptor in obese mice (Xiang et al. 2023).	Animals

1.A.8.11.3	Plasma membrane aquaporin 1, PIP1, PIP1;2, PIP1b, of 286 aas and 6 TMSs (Törnroth-Horsefield et al., 2006).  Transports H2O, H2O2 (Dynowski et al., 2008), O2 and CO2 (Zwiazek et al. 2017).  Forms active heterotetramers with PIP2;1 (1.A.8.11.4); down regulated under drought stress (Najafabadi et al., 2008); plays a role in salt tolerance (Li et al. 2018). Gated by H+, Ca2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+ (Verdoucq et al., 2008). The wheat orthologue has been described (Ayadi et al., 2011). 96% identical to PIP1;3. In Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm; spikemoss), SmPIP1;1 is retained in the ER while SmPIP2;1 is found in the plasma membrane but, upon co-expression, both isoforms are found in the plasma membrane as a heterotetramer, leading to a synergistic effect on water membrane permeability (Bienert et al. 2018). In some speices, PIP1 is inactive (e.g., in maize), but formation of a hetrotetramer with PIP2 allows transport (Vajpai et al. 2018). Transmembrane helices 2 and 3 determine the localization of plasma membrane PIPs (Wang et al. 2019). PIP1;2 from Malus domestica confers salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis (Wang et al. 2022).  The Pip1.1 and Pip1.2 of Brassica rapa mediate the uptake of neonicotinoid pesticides (Wan et al. 2024).

1.A.8.11.4	"Plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2a (forms active heterotetramers with PIP1;1 (TC# 1.A.8.11.3); down regulated under drought stress (Najafabadi et al., 2008). Transports H2O2 (Dynowski et al., 2008). The Mesembryanthemum crystallinum PIP2;1 orthologue is an aquaporin impermeable to urea and glycerol. It is positively regulated by PKA- and PKC- mediated phosphorylation (Amezcua-Romero et al., 2010). PIP1;1 and PIP2;2 (Q9ATM8) co-expression modulates the membrane water permeability in the halophyte Beta vulgaris storage root through a pH regulatory response, enhancing membrane versatility to adjust its water transfer capacity (Bellati et al., 2010). The wheat orthologue has been described (Ayadi et al., 2011).  Inter-TMS interactions occurring both within and between
monomers play crucial roles in tetramer formation, and assembly of tetramers is critical for their trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane as well as
water permeability (Yoo et al. 2016).  This protein as well as 1.A.8.11.6 is possibly orthologous to spinach 
PIP1;2 for which the crystal structure is available (PDP# 4JC6) (Berny et al. 2016).  Plays a role in drought and salt tolerance (Wang et al. 2015). PIP-type aqauporins may also transport CO2, boric acid, glycerol, arsenic and Na+ (Byrt et al. 2017). TMS2 and TMS3 are necessary and sufficient in AtPIP2 for its PM localization (Wang et al. 2019)."

1.A.8.11.7	Aquaporin PIP2;5 (PIP2-5) of 285 aas.  Transports water and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Bienert et al. 2014; ).  PIP1;2 doesn't transport H2O2.  TMS3 contains an LxxA motif that targets the protein to the plasma membrane from the ER.  While PIP2s are in the plasma mebrane, PIP1s are retained in the ER; this motif only partly explains the difference (Chevalier and Chaumont 2015).  PIP1;2 AND PIP2;5 form homo- and heterotetramers (Berny et al. 2016). PIP2;6 is 85% identical, and Ytterbium, Yb3+, increases water flow in corn roots by activiating PIP2;6, PIP2;2 and TIP2;2 (Vorob'ev et al. 2019).  Incubation with abscisic acid and the elicitor flg22 peptide induced the intracellular H2O2 accumulation in cells expressing ZmPIP2;5 (Ahmed et al. 2023).  Sugarcane mosaic virus employs the 6K2 protein to impair ScPIP2; 4 transport of H2O2 to facilitate virus infection (Zhang et al. 2023).

1.A.8.12.2	The silicon (silicic acid) (undissociated form) transporter, Lsi1 (Ma et al., 2007a, b; Mitani et al., 2008). The barley orthologue Lsi1 (also called NIP2-1) is also a silicon (silicic acid) uptake channel (Chiba et al., 2009). Rice Lsi1 also transports arsenite and pentavalent mono and dimethyl arsenite (Li et al., 2009). In addition to silicon (Si), selenite (Se) uptake is mediated by Lsi1 (Zhao et al., 2010).  Physicochemical and transcriptomic responses of Lactobacillus brevis JLD715 to sodium selenite have been reported (Yang et al. 2021). Many of the world's most important food crops such as rice, barley and maize accumulate silicon (Si) to high levels, resulting in better plant growth and crop yields (van den Berg et al. 2021). The first step in Si accumulation is the uptake of silicic acid by the roots, a process mediated by the NIP subfamily of aquaporins, also named metalloid porins. van den Berg et al. 2021 presented the X-ray crystal structure of the archetypal NIP family member from Oryza sativa (OsNIP2;1). The OsNIP2;1 channel is closed in the crystal structure by the cytoplasmic loop D, which is known to regulate channel opening in classical plant aquaporins. The structure reveals a novel, five-residue extracellular selectivity filter with a large diameter. Unbiased molecular dynamics simulations show a rapid opening of the channel to visualise how silicic acid interacts with the selectivity filter prior to transmembrane diffusion. These results may enable detailed structure-function studies of metalloid porins, including the basis of their substrate selectivity (van den Berg et al. 2021). Silicon (Si), the most abundant mineral element in the earth's crust, is taken up by plant roots in the form of silicic acid through Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1). Lsi1 belongs to the Nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein subfamily and shows high selectivity for silicic acid. The crystal structure of rice Lsi1 at a resolution of 1.8 Å reveals transmembrane helical orientations different from other aquaporins, characterized by a unique, widely opened, and hydrophilic selectivity filter composed of five residues. Structural, functional, and theoretical investigations provided a solid basis for the Si uptake mechanism in plants (Saitoh et al. 2021).	Plants

NIP2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 can also transport boric acid (Diehn et al. 2019). the grape ortholog can transport the same molecules (Sabir et al. 2020)."	Plants

In AqpM, isoleucine replaces a key histidine residue found in the lumen of water channels, which becomes a glycine residue in aquaglyceroporins. As a result of this and other side-chain substituents in the walls of the channel, the channel is intermediate in size and exhibits differentially tuned electrostatics when compared with the other subfamilies (Lee et al. 2005).

participate in PPi and poly P metabolism as well as volume regulation and are
 essential for virulence. A signalling pathway involving cyclic AMP 
generation is important for fusion of acidocalcisomes to the contractile
 vacuole complex, transference of aquaporin and volume regulation (Docampo et al. 2011).
 Hyperosmotic stress induces aquaporin-dependent cell shrinkage,

1.A.8.5.1	"FPS1 glycerol efflux facilitator. It is important for maintaining osmotic balance during mating-induced yeast cell fusion and for tolerating hypoosmotic shock; it also transports arsenite and antimonite). FPS1 is a homotetramer (Beese-Sims et al., 2011). It is important for osmo-adaptation by regulating intracellular glycerol levels during changes in external osmolarity. Upon high osmolarity conditions, yeast accumulate glycerol by increased production of the osmolyte and by restricting glycerol efflux through Fps1. The extended cytosolic termini of Fps1 contain short domains that are important for regulating glycerol flux through the channel (Hedfalk et al. 2004). The transmembrane core of the protein plays an equally important role (Geijer et al., 2012).  The MAP kinase, Slt2, physically interacts
with Fps1, and this interaction, dependent on phosphorylation of S537, regulates arsenite uptake (Ahmadpour et al. 2016). The N-terminal regulatory domain and the B-loop may interact in channel control (Karlgren et al. 2004). Fps1 resides in multi tetrameric clusters, and hyperosmotic and oxidative stress conditions cause Fps1 reorganization, and rapid exposure to hydrogen peroxide causes Fps1 degradation (Shashkova et al. 2021). Activation of the CWI pathway through high hydrostatic pressure, enhances glycerol efflux via Fps1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see family 9.B.454 in TCDB)."	Yeast

1.A.8.8.1	"Aquaporin 1 (CO2-, O2-, H202- and nitrous oxide-permeable and water-selective) (Zwiazek et al. 2017; Varadaraj and Kumari 2020). Aquaporin-1 tunes pain perception by interacting with Na(v)1.8 Na+ channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons (Zhang and Verkman, 2010). It is upregulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). AQP1 has been reported to
first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helices 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane.
In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the
orientation of the third helix is inverted, and it can shift out the membrane core (Virkki et al. 2014).  Its synthesis is regluated by Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2; Q9Y5W3) which also interacts directly with Aqp1 (Fontijn et al. 2015). A nanoscale ion pump has been derived artificially from Aqp1 (Decker et al. 2017). Mammalian AQP1 channels, activated by cyclic GMP, can carry non-selective monovalent cation currents, selectively blocked by arylsulfonamide compounds AqB007 (IC50 170 muM) and AqB011 (IC50 14 muM). Loop D-domain amino acids activate the channel for ion coductance (Kourghi et al. 2018). Water flux through AQP1s is inhibited by 1 - 10 mμM acetozolaminde (Gao et al. 2006). Aqp1 transports reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) which may induce oxidative stress in the cell interior. These RONS include both hydrophilic (H2O2 and OH) and hydrophobic (NO2 and NO) RONS (Yusupov et al. 2019).  The position of the Arg-195 side chain shows a number of interactions for loop C (Dingwell et al. 2019). AQP1 play vital roles in cellular homeostasis at rest and during endurance running exercises (Rivera and Fahey 2019). AQP1 and AQP4 activities correlate with the severity of hydrocephalus induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage (Long et al. 2019). AQPs are related to osmoregulation and play a critical role in maturation, cryo-stability and motility activation in boar spermatozoa (Delgado-Bermúdez et al. 2019). In foetal kidney, AQP1 expression appeared in the apical and basolateral parts of cells, lining the proximal convoluted tubules and the descending limb of Henle's loop, then in the tubule pole of Bowman's capsule (Ráduly et al. 2019). Inhibition of aquaporin-1 prevents myocardial remodeling by blocking the transmembrane transport of hydrogen peroxide (Montiel et al. 2020). AQP1 Is up-regulated by hypoxia and leads to increased cell water permeability, motility, and migration in neuroblastoma (Huo et al. 2021). Aqp1 allows the transport of CO2 across membranes (Michenkova et al. 2021). Down-regulation of aquaporin-1 mediates a microglial phenotype switch affecting glioma growth (Hu et al. 2020). AQP1 expression is down-regulated following repeated exposure of UVB via MEK/ERK activation pathways, and this AQP1 reduction leads to changes of physiological functions in dermal fibroblasts (Kim et al. 2020). AQP1 and AQP7 are differentially regulated under hyperosmotic stress conditions, and AQP1 acts as an osmotic stress sensor and response factor (Aggeli et al. 2021). AQP1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of Wilms' tumor (Liu et al. 2023).  Aquaporin-1 plays a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and pyroptosis of Wilms' tumor cells (Liu et al. 2024)."	Animals

1.A.8.8.2	"The lens fiber MIP aquaporin (Aqp0) of B. taurus (forms membrane junctions in vivo and double layered crystals in vitro that resemble the in vivo junctions).  The water pore is closed in the in vitro structure (Gonen et al., 2004b). It interacts directly with the intracellular loop of connexin 45.6 via its C-terminal extension (Yu et al., 2005). Forms human cataract lens membranes (Buzhynskyy et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011).  A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). AqpO catalyzes Zn2+-modulated water permeability as a cooperative tetramer (Nemeth-Cahalan et al., 2007). It transports ascorbic acid (Nakazawa et al., 2011). The Detergent organization around solubilized aquaporin-0 using Small Angle X-ray Scattering has been reported (Berthaud et al., 2012).  Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) in the eye lens is truncated by proteolytic cleavage during lens maturation. This truncated AQP0 is no longer a water channel (Berthaud et al. 2015).  A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). Cataractogenesis in MIP mutants are probably caused by defects in MIP gene expression in mice (Takahashi et al. 2017). This may be caused by the ability of Aqp0 (as well as Aqp1 and Aqp5) to transport hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which can cause cataracts (Varadaraj and Kumari 2020).  An automated data processing and analysis pipeline for transmembrane proteins including Aqp0 in detergent solutions has been presented (Molodenskiy et al. 2020). EphA2 is required for normal Cx50 localization to the cell membrane, and
 conductance of lens fiber cells requires normal Eph-ephrin signaling 
and water channel (Aqp0) localization (Cheng et al. 2021). The local curvature of cellular membranes acts as a driving force for 
the targeting of membrane-associated proteins to specific membrane 
domains, as well as a sorting mechanism for transmembrane proteins, as 
demonstrated for Aqp0; AQP0 causes small negative curvature (Kluge et al. 2022)."	Animals

The sequence reveals a mercurial-sensitive cysteine and a putative phosphorylation motif site for protein kinase A at Ser-257 (Kubota et al. 2006). A swelling assay using Xenopus oocytes revealed that AQP-x5 facilitated water permeability. Expression of AQP-x5 mRNA was restricted to the skin, brain, lungs and testes. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopical studies using an anti-peptide antibody (ST-156) against the C-terminal region of the AQP-x5 protein revealed the presence of immunopositive cells in the skin, with the label predominately localized in the apical plasma membrane of the secretory cells of the small granular glands. These glands are unique both in being close to the epidermal layer of the skin and in containing mitochondria-rich cells with vacuolar H+-ATPase dispersed among its secretory cells. Results from immunohistochemical experiments on the mucous or seromucous glands of several other anurans verified this result (Kubota et al. 2006).	Aqp-x5 of Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog)

Molecular phylogenies indicated that Aqp3-like and Aqp13-like channels were the probable stem subfamilies in craniates, with WGD generating Aqp9 and Aqp10 in gnathostomes but Aqp7 arising through TD in Osteichthyes (Yilmaz et al. 2020).

BIB conductance shows voltage- and dose-dependent block by extracellular divalent cations Ca2+ and Ba2+ but not by Mg2+ in wild-type channels (Yanochko and Yool 2004). Site-directed mutagenesis of negatively charged glutamate (Glu274) and aspartate (Asp253) residues had no effect on divalent cation block, but mutation of Glu71 in the first TMS altered channel properties (Yanochko and Yool 2004).

Two well conserved glycine residues: Gly-57 in TMS 2 and Gly-173 in TMS 5 reside at the contact point where the two helices cross. Mammalian orthologs of AQP6 have an asparagine residue (Asn-60) at the position corresponding to Gly-57 in Aqp6. Liu et al. 2005 showed that a single residue substitution (N60G in rat AQP6) eliminates anion permeability but increases water permeability.	Animals
1.A.8.8.5	"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major water channel in the central nervous system and plays an important role in the brain's water balance, including edema formation and clearance. There are 6 splice variants; the shorter ones assemble into functional, tetrameric square arrays; the longer is palmitoylated on N-terminal cysteyl residues) (Suzuki et al., 2008). The longest, Aqp4e, has a novel N-terminal domain and forms a water channel in the plasma membrane although various shorter variants don't (Moe et al., 2008). AQP4, like AQP0 (1.A.8.8.2), forms water channels but also forms adhesive junctions (Engel et al., 2008) (causes cytotoxic brain swelling in mice (Yang et al., 2008)) Mice lacking Aqp4 have impaired olfactions (Lu et al., 2008). Aqp4 is down regulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). The crystal structure is known to 2.8 Å resolution (Tani et al., 2009). The structure reveals 8 water molecules in each of the four channels, supporting a hydrogen-bond isolation mechanism and explains its fast and selective water conduction and proton exclusion (Tani et al., 2009; Cui and Bastien, 2011). It is an important antigen in Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients (Kalluri et al., 2011).  A connection has been made between AQP4-mediated fluid accumulation and post traumatic syringomyelia (Hemley et al. 2013).  AQP4 has increased water
permeability at low pH, and His95 is the pH-dependent gate (Kaptan et al. 2015).  Also transports NH3 but not NH4+ (Assentoft et al. 2016). Cerebellar damage following status epilepticus involves down regulation of AQP4 expression (Tang et al. 2017). SUR1-TRPM4 and AQP4 form a complex to increase bulk water influx during astrocyte swelling (Stokum et al. 2017). A mutation, S111T, causes intellectual disability, hearing loss, and progressive gait dysfunction (Berland et al. 2018). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp4, is found in brain > kidney > stomach (Ramírez-Lorca et al. 2006). A Molecular Dynamics Investigation on Human AQP4 has been published (Marracino et al. 2018). AQP1 and AQP4 activities correlate with the severity of hydrocephalus induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage (Long et al. 2019). Di-lysine motif-like sequences formed by deleting the C-terminal domain of aquaporin-4 prevent its trafficking to the plasma membrane (Chau et al. 2021). Kidins220 deficiency causes ventriculomegaly via SNX27-retromer-dependent AQP4 degradation (Del Puerto et al. 2021). AQP4 expression is upregulated in cells exposed to dexamethasone, and SUMOylation [Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs)] may participate in this regulation (Zhang et al. 2020). Simultaneous calmodulin binding to the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of aquaporin 4 has been demonstrated (Ishida et al. 2021). Aqp-4 plays a role in secondary pathological processes (spinal cord edema, glial scar formation, and inflammatory response) after spinal cord injury, SCI. Loss of AQP-4 is associated with reduced spinal edema and improved prognosis after SCI in mice, and downregulation of AQP-4 reduces glial scar formation and the inflammatory response after SCI (Pan et al. 2022). AQP4 contributes to the migration and proliferation of gliomas, and to their resistance to therapy. In glioma cell cultures, in both subcutaneous and orthotopic gliomas in rats, and in glioma tumours in patients, that transmembrane water-efflux rate is a sensitive biomarker of AQP4 expression (Jia et al. 2022). Aquaporin 4 is required for T cell receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation (Nicosia et al. 2023). Peripheral lung infections influence the blood brain barrier (BBB) water exchange, which appears to be mediated by endothelial dysfunction and is associated with an increase in perivascular AQP4 (Ohene et al. 2023). Trifluoperazine reduces apoptosis and 
inflammatory responses in traumatic brain injury by preventing the 
accumulation of Aquaporin4 on the surface of brain cells (Xing et al. 2023). Cation flux through SUR1-TRPM4 and NCX1 in astrocyte
 endfeet induces water influx through AQP4 and brain swelling after 
ischemic stroke (Stokum et al. 2023). Aquaporin-4 expression and modulation may be important in a rat model of post-traumatic syringomyelia (Berliner et al. 2023).  The Aqp4 water channel may be a drug target for Alzheimer's Disease (Silverglate et al. 2023). A series of 2,4,5-trisubstituted oxazoles 3a-j were synthesized by a Lewis acid mediated reaction of aroylmethylidene malonates with nitriles. In silico studies conducted using the protein data bank (PDB) structure 3gd8 for AQP4 revealed that compound 3a would serve as a suitable candidate to inhibit AQP4 in human lung cells (NCI-H460). In vitro studies demonstrated that compound 3a could effectively inhibit AQP4 and inflammatory cytokines in lung cells, and hence it may be considered as a viable drug candidate for the treatment of various lung diseases (Meenakshi et al. 2023).   The effect of AQP4 and its palmitoylation on the permeability of exogenous reactive oxygen species has been considered (Cao et al. 2023). ORI-TRN-002 exhibits superior solubility and overcomes free fraction 
limitations compared to other reported AQP4 inhibitors, suggesting its 
potential as a promising anti-edema therapy for treating cerebral edema (Thormann et al. 2024).    New biomarkers, such as aquaporin 4 have led to the 
identification of antigen-specific immune-mediated myelopathies and 
approved therapies to prevent disease progression (Levy 2024)."	Animals

1.A.8.8.8	"Vasopressin-sensitive aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) in the apical membrane of the renal collecting duct (Fenton et al., 2008).  Controls cell volume and thereby influences cell proliferation (Di Giusto et al. 2012).  It  plays a
key role in concentrating urine. Water reabsorption is regulated by AQP2 trafficking between
intracellular storage vesicles and the apical membrane. This process is tightly controlled by the
pituitary hormone arginine vasopressin, and defective trafficking results in nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (NDI).  The crystal structure of Aqp2 has been solved to 2.75 Å (Frick et al. 2014).  In terrestrial vertebrates, AQP2 function is generally regulated by arginine-vasopressin to
accomplish key functions in osmoregulation such as the maintenance of body water
homeostasis by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism (Olesen and Fenton 2017; Martos-Sitcha et al. 2015). AQP2 is expressed in the anterior vaginal wall and fibroblasts, and regulates the expression level of collagen I/III i, suggesting that AQP2 is associated with the pathogenesis of stress urinary incontinence through collagen metabolism during ECM remodeling (Zhang et al. 2017). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp2, is found only in the kidney (Ramírez-Lorca et al. 2006).  AQP2 is critical in regulating urine concentrating ability. The expression and function of AQP2 are regulated by a series of transcriptional factors and post-transcriptional phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation (He and Yang 2019). Mutation or functional deficiency of AQP2 leads to severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and inhibition of various aquaporins leads to many water-related diseases such as, edema, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Maroli et al. 2019 reported on the molecular mechanisms of mycotoxin (citrinin, ochratoxin-A, and T-2 mycotoxin) inhibition of AQP2 and arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). Aquaporin-2 mutations cause Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Li et al. 2021). Meniere's disease is affected by dexamethasone which is a direct modulator of AQP2. The molecular mechanisms involved in dexamethasone binding to and its regulatory action upon AQP2 function have been described (Mom et al. 2022). Interaction of cortisol with aquaporin-2 modulates its water permeability (Mom et al. 2023). In the kidney collecting duct, arginine vasopressin-dependent trafficking of AQP2 fine-tunes reabsorption of water from pre-urine, allowing precise regulation of the final urine volume. Point mutations in the gene for AQP2 disturbs this process and leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), wherein patients void large volumes of hypo-osmotic urine. In recessive NDI, mutants of AQP2 are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to misfolding. The structures allow interpretation of these results (Hagströmer et al. 2023). Differential regulation of autophagy on urine-concentrating capability occurs through modulating renal AQP2 expression (Xu et al. 2023)."	Animals
1.A.8.8.9	"Aquaporin 5 (x-ray structure at 2.0 Å resolution (PDB# 3D9S) is available) (Horsefield et al., 2008). Aqp5 is a marker for proliferation and migration of human breast cancer cells (Jung et al., 2011). Plays a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Zhao et al. 2014).  Its expression is regulated by androgens (Pust et al. 2015). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp5, is found in the intestine, the jejunum, ileum and colon (Ramírez-Lorca et al. 2006). Proteomic analyses of the ocular lens revealed palmitoylation (Wang and Schey 2018). Aquaporin 5 expression correlates with tumor multiplicity and vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (Vireak et al. 2019). The ability of Aqp5 (as well as Aqp0 and Aqp1) to transport hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may cause cataracts in the eye (Varadaraj and Kumari 2020). AQP3 and AQP5 play important but different roles in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation in dogs (Mirabella et al. 2021). The up-regulation of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 in skin during summer season indicates roles in thermoregulation (Debbarma et al. 2020). Aqp5 interacts with TRPV4 (see 1.A.4.2.5 for the rat ortholog) (Kemény and Ducza 2022). AQP5 facilitates osmotically driven water flux across biological membranes as well as the movement of hydrogen peroxide and CO2. Various mechanisms dynamically regulate AQP5 expression, trafficking, and function. Besides fulfilling its primary water permeability function, AQP5 regulates downstream effectors (D'Agostino et al. 2023). Modulation of membrane trafficking of AQP5 in 
the lens in response to changes in zonular tension is mediated by TRPV1 (Petrova et al. 2023).Methazolamide reduces AQP5 mRNA expression and immune cell migration, and may be a drug for sepsis  therapy (Rump et al. 2024)."	Animals

1.A.8.9.1	Aquaporin 3. 95% identical to the human orthologue. Poorly permeable to water, but more permeable to glycerol and arsenic trioxide (Palmgren et al. 2017).  It is expressed in the plasma membrane of basal epidermal cells in the skin; loss of function prevents skin tumorigenesis and epidermal cell proliferation (Hara-Chikuma and Verkman, 2008).  The human orthologue also transports both water and glycerol and is the predominant AQP in skin (Jungersted et al. 2013). It's function is necessary for normal proliferation of colon cancer cells due to glycerol uptake (Li et al. 2016). Aqp3 is implicated in cancer progression to the metastatic state as its function promotes cell migration and cell shape plasticity.  Its synthesis is regulated by the AhR (aryl hydrocarbon (pollutant) receptor or dioxin receptor), a transcription factor triggered by environmental pollutants (Bui et al. 2016). Trefoil factor (TFF) peptides increase cell water permeability and induce prodcution of Aqp3 (Marchbank and Playford 2018). Although AQP3 and other similar transmembrane proteins do not themselves transport drugs, changes in their expression levels can cause changes in cell membrane fluidity, thus affecting drug absorption rates (Ikarashi et al. 2019).  AQP3 levels are elevated in human endometrioid carcinoma (Watanabe et al. 2020). AQP3 and AQP5 play important roles in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation in dogs (Mirabella et al. 2021). AQP-1, 3 and 8 levels in amniotic fluid were measured in patients suffering from polyhydramnios. They were compared to the levels observed in control subjects, and their relationship with maternal factors and neonatal issues was analyzed. AQP-1, 3, 8 levels physiologically fluctuated, AQP-1 levels were the lowest and AQP-3 the highest, with a decrease at the end of pregnancy (Guibourdenche et al. 2021). The human ortholog, Aqp3 (Q92482) is 95% identical. It transports water, glycerol and urea, and is the blood group antigen, GIL (Roudier et al. 2002). Intra-endolymphatic sac steroids have regulatory effects on inner ear AQP-3 expression via the vestibular aqueduct and modulate the homeostasis of endolymphatic fluids (Kitahara et al. 2003).	Animals

Primary APL cells express AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemia cells (AMLs), explaining their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity (Leung et al. 2007). AQP-7 and AQP-9-mediated glycerol transport in tanycyte cells may be 
under hormonal control to use glycerol as an energy source during the 
mouse estrus cycle (Yaba et al. 2017). It transports multiple neutral and ionic arsenic species including arsenic trioxide, monomethylarsenous acid (MAs(III)) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA(V)). It also transports clinically relevant selenium species including monomethylselenic acid (MSeA), especially at acidic pH. FCCP, valinomycin and nigericin do not significantly inhibit MSeA uptake, but AQP9 also transport ionic selenite and lactate, with low efficiency compared with MSeA uptake. Selenite and lactate uptake is pH dependent and inhibited by FCCP and nigericin but not valinomycin. The selenite and lactate uptake via AQP9 can be inhibited by different lactate analogs. AQP9 transport of MSeA, selenite and lactate is inhibited by an AQP9 inhibitor, phloretin, and the AQP9 substrate, arsenite (As(III)) (Geng et al. 2017). The host aquaporin-9 is required for efficient Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite entry into human hepatocytes (Amanzougaghene et al. 2021).

(Regulated by CFTR and NHERF1 in response to cyclic AMP (Pietrement et al., 2008)) The 7 Å projection structure and a homology model revealed that pore-lining residues and the hydrophobic edge of the tripathic pore of GlpF (1.A.8.1.1) provide the basis for broad substrate specificity (Viadiu et al., 2007).  It is important for urea transport in mouse hepatocytes (Jelen et al. 2012).  Activation of the PPARα transcription factor results in reduction in the abundance of
AQP9 in periportal hepatocytes, but its activation in the fed state directs glycerol into
glycerolipid synthesis rather than into de novo synthesis of glucose (Lebeck et al. 2015).  Azacytidine up-regulates AQP9 and enhances arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-mediated

 as a glycerol transporter in skin and plays an important role in 
regulating the stratum corneum and epidermal glycerol content. It is involved
 in skin hydration, wound healing, and tumorigenesis, and it provides the kidney 
medullary collecting duct with high permeability to water, thereby 
permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient. It is slightly permeable to urea and H2O2, and may function as a water and urea exit 
mechanism in antidiuresis in collecting duct cells. It may play an 
important role in gastrointestinal tract water transport and in glycerol
 metabolism. Breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis are related to AQP3, which is the transmembrane transport channel for H2O2 molecules (Zhong et al. 2022). AQP3 plays a key role in cancer and metastasis. RoT inhibits human AQP3 activity with an IC50 in the micromolar range (22.8 ± 5.8 µM for water and 6.7 ± 3.0 µM for
 glycerol permeability inhibition). RoT blocks AQP3-glycerol permeation by establishing 
strong and stable interactions at the extracellular region of AQP3 pores (Paccetti-Alves et al. 2023). AQP3-mediated activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 
signaling pathway curtails gallstone formation in mice by inhibiting 
inflammatory injury of gallbladder mucosal epithelial cells (Wang et al. 2023).  The main subtype expressed in the epidermis and dermis is AQP3. AQPs exert certain physiological functions in the skin, such as the maintenance of normal shape, the regulation of body temperature, moisturization and hydration, anti-aging, damage repair and antigen presentation. The abnormal expression of AQPs in skin cells can lead to a variety of skin diseases (Liu et al. 2023).  AQP3 promotes the invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer by regulating NOX4-derived H2O2 activation of the Syk/PI3K/Akt signaling axis.

It may be a drug target for anti-type 2 diabetes (Méndez-Giménez et al. 2018). AQP-7- and AQP-9-mediated glycerol transport in tanycyte cells may be under hormonal control to use glycerol as an energy source during the mouse estrus cycle (Yaba et al. 2017).  It may also influence whole body energy metabolism (Iena and Lebeck 2018) including in the kidney (Schlosser et al. 2023).

parkinsonism; it is a cell surface-localized Mn2+ efflux
transporter, and parkinsonism-causing mutations block its trafficking and efflux activity. Residues in the
transmembrane and C-terminal domains together confer optimal Mn2+ transport capability (Zogzas et al. 2016). Residues involved in Mn2+ binding in the transmembrane domain have been identified, and they differ in position and nature from the Zn2+ binding site in Zn2+ transporting members of the CDF family (Zogzas and Mukhopadhyay 2018). Loss of ZnT10 expression caused by autosomal mutations in the ZnT10 gene leads to hypermanganesemia in multiple organs (Levy et al. 2019). The cellular transport of Mn2+ is coupled to a reciprocal movement of Ca2+. Replacing a single asparagine residue in ZnT10 (Asn-43) with threonine (ZnT10 N43T) converted the Mn2+/Ca2+ exchanger into an uncoupled channel permeable to both Ca2+ and Mn2+ (Levy et al. 2019).

2.A.4.3.5	"Homodimeric solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8, ZnT8 or ZnT-8.  An inherited R325W mutant gives aberant zinc transport in pancreatic beta cells (Weijers 2010).  It is chiefly expressed in pancreatic islet cells, where it mediates zinc (Zn2+) uptake into secretory granules. It plays a role in glucose tolerance (Mitchell et al. 2016). ZnT8 is one of four human vesicular zinc transporters. It supplies millimolar zinc concentrations to insulin granules in pancreatic beta-cells, affecting insulin processing, crystallisation, and secretion. ZnT8 has a transmembrane and a C-terminal cytosolic domain; the latter has important functions and purportedly mediates protein-protein interactions, senses cytosolic zinc, and channels zinc to the transport site in the transmembrane domain (Parsons et al. 2018). The  variant, W325R, in the C-terminal domain (CTD) increases the risk to develop type 2 diabetes and affects autoantibody specificity in type 1 diabetes. The CTDs of the WT and mutant proteins form tetramers which are stabilized by zinc binding and exhibit negligible differences in their secondary structural content and zinc-binding affinities in solution (Ullah et al. 2020). Xue et al. 2020 described cryo-EM structures in both outward- and inward-facing conformations. HsZnT8 forms a dimeric structure with four Zn2+ binding sites within each subunit with a highly conserved primary site in the TMD housing the Zn2+ substrate. An interfacial site between the TMD and the CTD modulates the Zn2+ transport activity. Two adjacent sites buried in the cytosolic domain are chelated by conserved residues from CTD and the His-Cys-His (HCH) motif from the N-terminal segment of the neighboring subunit. A comparison of the outward- and inward-facing structures reveals that the TMD of each subunit undergoes a large structural rearrangement, allowing for alternating access to the primary Zn2+ site during the transport cycle (Xue et al. 2020). The C-terminal domain of the human zinc transporter hZnT8 Is structurally indistinguishable from its disease risk variant (R325W) (Ullah et al. 2020). The dynamics of ZnT8 have been studied (Sala et al. 2021), revealing that packing of the TMSs affects channel accessibility from the cytosol. The dimer interface that keeps the two TM channels in contact became looser in both variants upon zinc binding to the transport site, suggesting that this may be an important step toward the switch from the inward- to the outward-facing states of the protein (Sala et al. 2021). The C-terminal cysteines, which are part of the cytosolic domain, are involved in a metal chelation and/or acquisition mechanism, and provides the first example of metal-thiolate coordination chemistry in zinc transporters (Catapano et al. 2021). Human ZnT8 (SLC30A8) is a diabetes risk factor and a zinc transporter (Daniels et al. 2020). ZnT8 loss of function mutations increase resistance of human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells to apoptosis unswe low zinc conditions (Sui et al. 2023).  Protons may disrupt Zn2+ coordination at the transmembrane Zn2+-binding site in the lumen-facing state, thus facilitating Zn2+ release from ZnT8 into the lumen (based on the cryoEM structure of the Xenopus tropecalis ZnT8 (Zhang et al. 2023).

Bui et al. 2023 presented the 2.2-3.1 Å-resolution cryo-EM structures of the human Zn2+/H+ antiporter ZnT7 in Zn2+-bound and unbound forms. Cryo-EM analyses show that hZnT7 exists as a dimer via tight interactions in both the cytosolic and transmembrane (TM) domains of two protomers, each of which contains a single Zn2+-binding site in its TM domain. hZnT7 undergoes a TM-helix rearrangement to create a negatively charged cytosolic cavity for Zn2+ entry in the inward-facing conformation and widens the luminal cavity for Zn2+ release in the outward-facing conformation. An exceptionally long cytosolic histidine-rich loop, characteristic of hZnT7, binds two Zn2+ ions, seemingly facilitating Zn2+ recruitment to the TM metal transport pathway.

The structure (3.8 Å resolution) reveals a homodimer interconnected at the cytoplasmic domain through four Zn2+ ions. A 6 TMS bundle features of a tetrahedral Zn2+ binding site (Lu and Fu, 2007). The gated water access to the transport site enables a stationary proton gradient
to facilitate the conversion of zinc-binding energy to the kinetic power stroke of a vectorial zinc
transport (Gupta et al. 2014). Of the two cavities of the dimer, only one was accessible from the cytosol during transport. Zinc(II) binding to D49 of the transport site triggered a rearrangement of the TMS that closed the accessible cavity. The free-energy profiles of metal transit in the channel suggested the existence of a high barrier preventing release from the transport site (Sala et al. 2019). The mechanism of zinc transport through YiiP has been proposed (Sharma and Merz 2022)."	Bacteria

 binding to the cytoplasmic fragment creates a docking site to which a 
metallochaperone can bind for delivery and transport of zinc. A proposal was advanced that it functions as a 
metallochaperone and regulates the zinc-transporting activity of
 the full-length protein. The latter requires that zinc binding becomes

MamM was used to probe the role of the hydrophilic C-terminal domain (CTD) in metal recognition and selectivity. Different metals bind to MamM CTD, suggesting a varying level of functional discrimination between CDF domains. Thus, CDF CTDs play a role in metal selectivity. MamM's CTD discriminates against Mn2+, supporting a role in preventing magnetite formation poisoning in magnetotactic bacteria via Mn2+ incorporation (Barber-Zucker et al. 2020).	Bacteria
2.A.4.7.4	"Putative magnetosome membrane iron transporter, MamM.  Forms a heterodimeric stable

MamM are essential for magnetite biomineralization and are involved in 
several steps in magnetosome formation, but only MamB is essential for 
formation of magnetosome membrane vesicles (Uebe et al. 2011). Most CDF proteins contain two domains, the cation transporting transmembrane domain and the regulatory cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD). A MamM M250P mutation that is synonymous with the disease-related mutation L349P of the human CDF protein, ZnT-10 causes severe structural changes in its CTD, resulting in abnormally reduced function.Thus, the CTD fold is critical for the CDF proteins' proper function and suggest that the CDF cytoplasmic domain is a CDF regulatory element (Barber-Zucker et al. 2016).

TMEM163 is found in synaptic vesicles where it is called SV31 (Burré et al. 2007). It plays a role in Zn2+ uptake into lysosomes (Cuajungco and Kiselyov 2017). TMEM163 proteins catalyze Zn2+ efflux from cells and are critical for the biogenesis of platelet dense granules in mice (Yuan et al. 2021). TMEM163's discovery, transport feature, protein interactome, and similarities, as well as differences, with known SLC30 (ZnT) protein family members have been reviewed (Styrpejko and Cuajungco 2021). These authors also examined recent reports that implicate TMEM163 directly or indirectly in various human diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Mucolipidosis type IV and diabetes. TMEM163 is a dimer that catalyzes Zn2+ efflux from cells, or uptake into intracellular vesicles including lysosomes. TMEM163 dimerizes with itself, but it also heterodimerizes with ZNT1, ZNT2, ZNT3, and ZNT4 proteins (Escobar et al. 2022).	Animals

3.D.3.5.2	"Cytochrome b6f complex, PetB, PetC, PetD, PetM, Hcf164. The dimeric photosynthetic cytochrome b6f complex, a 16-mer of eight
distinct subunits and 26 transmembrane helices, catalyzes transmembrane proton-coupled electron
transfer for energy storage. Using a 2.5 Å crystal structure of the dimeric complex, Hasan and Cramer 2014 identified
23 distinct lipid-binding sites per monomer. Annular lipids provide a connection for
super-complex formation with the photosystem-I reaction center and the LHCII kinase for
transmembrane signaling. Internal lipids mediate crosslinking to stabilize the domain-swapped iron-sulfur protein subunit, dielectric heterogeneity within intermonomer and intramonomer electron
transfer pathways, and dimer stabilization through lipid-mediated intermonomer interactions.  In the cytochrome b6f
complex with the quinol analog, stigmatellin, which partitions in the Qp portal of the bc1 complex,
but not of b6f, the Qp portal is partially occluded in the b6f
complex relative to bc1. Occlusion of the Qp portal
is attributed to the presence of the chlorophyll phytyl tail, which increases the quinone residence
time within the Qp portal and is inferred to be a cause of enhanced superoxide production (Hasan et al. 2014).  PetD subunit integration into the thylakoid membrane is a post-translational and an SRP-dependent process that requires the formation of a cpSRP-cpFtsY-ALB3-PetD complex (Króliczewski et al. 2017). The b6f complex plays a role in trans-membrane signal 
transduction from reductant. The effect of the p-side of the electron 
transport chain on the regulation of light energy to the two 
photosystems by trans-side phosphorylation of the light-harvesting 
chlorophyll protein has been discussed (Cramer 2018). The cryo-EM structure of the spinach cytochrome b6 f complex has been solved at 3.6 A resolution (Malone et al. 2019). The cytb6f complex links electron transfer between photosystems I and II and converting solar energy into a pmf for ATP synthesis. Electron transfer within cytb6 f occurs via the quinol (Q) cycle, which catalyses the oxidation of plastoquinol (PQH2) and the reduction of both plastocyanin (PC) and plastoquinone (PQ) at two separate sites via electron bifurcation. In higher plants, cytb6 f also acts as a redox-sensing hub, pivotal to the regulation of light harvesting and cyclic electron transfer that protect against metabolic and environmental stresses. Malone et al. 2019 presented a 3.6 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the dimeric cytb6 f complex from spinach, which reveals the structural basis for operation of the Q cycle and its redox-sensing function. The complex contains up to three natively bound PQ molecules. The first, PQ1, is located in one cytb6 f monomer near the PQ oxidation site (Qp), adjacent to haem bp and chlorophyll a. Two conformations of the chlorophyll a phytyl tail were resolved, one that prevents access to the Qp site and another that permits it, supporting a gating function for the chlorophyll a involved in redox sensing. PQ2 straddles the intermonomer cavity, partially obstructing the PQ reduction site (Qn) on the PQ1 side and committing the electron transfer network to turnover at the occupied Qn site in the neighbouring monomer. A conformational switch involving the haem cn propionate promotes two-electron, two-proton reduction at the Qn site and avoids formation of the reactive intermediate semiquinone. The location of a tentatively assigned third PQ molecule is consistent with a transition between the Qp and Qn sites in opposite monomers during the Q cycle. The spinach cytb6 f structure therefore provides new insights into how the complex fulfils its catalytic and regulatory roles in photosynthesis (Malone et al. 2019). Cytochrome b6f (cytb6f) lies at the heart of the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis, where it serves as a link between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) through the oxidation and reduction of the electron carriers plastoquinol (PQH2) and plastocyanin (Pc). A mechanism of electron bifurcation, known as the Q-cycle, couples electron transfer to the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient for ATP synthesis. Cytb6f catalyses the rate-limiting step in linear electron transfer, is pivotal for cyclic electron transfer and plays a key role as a redox-sensing hub involved in the regulation of light-harvesting, electron transfer and photosynthetic gene expression (Malone et al. 2021).  Xiao et al. 2022 investigated the phytotoxicity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), graphene oxide (GO) and amine-functionalized graphene (G-NH2) on Brassica napus L. RGO impaired photosynthesis mainly by decreasing the chlorophyll content and Rubisco activity. This effect of RGO could be due to its toxicity on sulfate transmembrane transporter and nitrogen metabolism, which ultimately led to nutrient imbalance. However, GO directly damaged the photosystem by disrupting the chloroplast structure, and a decrease in Rubisco activity indicated that GO also inhibits carbon fixation. Gene-level analysis demonstrated that GO has toxicity on the chloroplast membrane, photosystem, photosynthethic electron transport and F-type ATPase (Xiao et al. 2022). Regulation of the generation of reactive oxygen species during photosynthetic electron transport has been discussed (Krieger-Liszkay and Shimakawa 2022). Cyclic electron transfer and photoreduction of oxygen contribute to the size of the proton gradient. The yield of singlet oxygen production in photosystem II is regulated by changes in the midpoint potential of its primary quinone acceptor. In addition, numerous antioxidants inside the photosystems, the antenna and the thylakoid membrane quench or scavenge ROS (Krieger-Liszkay and Shimakawa 2022).

two hairpins, posing a plausible pathway for substrate transport. A combination of the crystal
structure and biochemical functional assays suggests that MtrF is an antibiotic efflux pump
mediating bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs (Su et al. 2015). MtrF and YdaH, (TC#2.A.68.1.4) and the dicarboxylate transporter, INDY (TC#2.a.47.5.2) have been shown to have the same 3-d fold (Vergara-Jaque et al. 2015), confirming the assignment of these two families to the same superfamily (Prakash et al. 2003)."

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter of pulmonary type 2 cells determines the severity of acute lung injury (Islam et al. 2022).

The channel is a homotetramer with two-fold symmetry in its amino-terminal domain (NTD) that adopts a structure similar to that of human MCU. The NTD assembles as a dimer of dimers to form a tetrameric ring that connects to the transmembrane domain through an elongated coiled-coil domain. The ion-conducting pore domain maintains four-fold symmetry, with the selectivity filter positioned at the start of the pore-forming TM2 helix. The aspartate and glutamate sidechains of the conserved DIME motif are oriented towards the central axis and separated by one helical turn (Nguyen et al. 2018).

1.A.77.1.17	CMU of 248 aas and 2 TMSs.  It functions together with the EMRE regulatory protein (TC#8.A.45.1.6).  MCU and EMRE form the minimal functional unit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex in metazoans. Wang et al. 2020 functionally reconstituted an MCU-EMRE complex from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and determined a cryo-EM structure of the complex at 3.5 Å resolution. They demonstrated Ca2+ uptake into proteoliposomes containing the purified complex. Uptake depended on EMRE as well as cardiolipin. The structure revealed a tetrameric channel with a single ion pore. EMRE was located at the periphery of the transmembrane domain and associates primarily with the first TMS of MCU. Coiled-coil and juxtamembrane domains within the matrix portion of the complex adopt markedly different conformations than in a structure of a human MCU-EMRE complex, suggesting that the structures represent different conformations of these functionally similar metazoan channels (Wang et al. 2020).

2.A.66.1.1	Drug:Na+  antiporter (norfloxacin, ethidium, kanamycin, ciprofloxin, streptomycin efflux pump), NorM. Transport is dependent on Na+, and several essential residiues have been identified. Specifically, Asp32, Glu251, and Asp367 are involved in the Na+-dependent drug transport process. (Otsuka et al. 2005).	Bacteria
2.A.66.1.10	"Na -dependent cationic drug (ethidium, acriflavine, 2-N-methyl ellipticinium, berberine, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, rhodamine 6G, crystal violet, doxorubicin, novobiocin, enoxacin, and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride) efflux pump, NorM (Long et al. 2008).  3-d structures of the N. gonorrheae NorM transporter (96% identical to the N. miningitidis protein) have been solved complexed with three different substrates in a multidrug cavity and Cs  (4HUN; Lu et al. 2013).  Lu et al. an identified an uncommon cation-π interaction in the Na+-binding site located 
outside the drug-binding cavity and validated the biological relevance 
of both the substrate- and cation-binding sites by conducting drug 
resistance and transport assays. Additionally, they observed a potential 
rearrangement of at least two transmembrane helices upon Na+-induced 
drug export. They suggested
 that Na+ triggers multidrug extrusion by inducing protein 
conformational changes rather than by directly competing for the 
substrate-binding amino acids.  However, see 2.A.66.1.32 where the opposite was concluded for a homologue that functions by drug:H+ antiport."	Bacteria

The 3-d x-ray structure (3.65Å resolution) is available (He et al., 2010). Ion binding and internal hydration have been studied by molecular dynamics simulations (Vanni et al., 2012).  NorM simultaneously couples drug export to the sodium-motive force and the proton-motive force. Residues involved and protein regions that play important roles in Na+ or H+ binding have been identified (Jin et al. 2014). Na+- and H+-driven conformational changes are facilitated by a network of polar residues in the N-terminal domain cavity, whereas conserved carboxylates buried in the C-terminal domain are critical for stabilizing the drug-bound state. These results establish the role of ion-coupled conformational dynamics in the functional cycle and implicate H+ in the doxorubicin release mechanism (Claxton et al. 2018).	Bacteria

2.A.66.1.50	"Detoxification protein, DTX35, of 614 aas and 12 TMSs, also called FLOWER FLAVONOID TRANSPORTER (FFT), encodes a MATE

transcribed in floral tissues, the transcript being localized to 
epidermal guard cells, including those of the anthers, stigma, siliques 
and nectaries (Thompson et al. 2010). The absence of FFT affects flavonoid levels in the plant. Moreover, root growth, seed 
development and germination, and pollen development, release and 
viability are all affected (Thompson et al. 2010). Also functions as a chloride channel, which, together with DTX33, is essential for turgor regulation (Zhang et al. 2017).

Contributes to iron homeostasis during stress responses and senescence (Seo et al. 2012). Overexpression of DTX48 alters shoot developmental programs leading to a loss of apical dominance phenotype (Wang et al. 2015).	DTX48 of Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)
2.A.66.1.52	Detoxification protein 14, DTX14, of 485 aas and 12 TMSs.  This MATE family (MOP superfamily) proter extrduces xenobiotics from the cell.  It's 3-d structure is known to 2.6 Å resolution (Miyauchi et al. 2017). Its carboxy-terminal lobe (C-lobe) contains an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with well-conserved acidic residues, as demonstrated by structure-based mutational analyses. The analyses suggest that the transport mechanism involves a structural change of transmembrane helix 7, induced by the formation of a hydrogen-bonding network upon the protonation of the conserved acidic residue in the C-lobe (Miyauchi et al. 2017).	DTX14 of Arabidopsis thaliana
2.A.66.1.53	Citrate exporter, MATE1 or DETOXIFICATION, of 553 aas and 12 probable TMSs.  It's activity gives rise to aluminum (Al3+) tolerance (Garcia-Oliveira et al. 2014). 98% identical to the rye and barley orthologs (Zhou et al. 2013).	MATE1 of Tritium aestivum (Wheat)
2.A.66.1.54	MATE2 or Detoxification 47 (DTX47) of 543 aas and 12 TMSs.  The orthologs from several plants have been sequenced and characterized (i.e., wheat; potato) (Li et al. 2018).  This protein may be a citrate and salicylate exporter and promote resistance to aluminum (Al3+) (Garcia-Oliveira et al. 2018). It may also transport cyanidine-3-glucoside (anthocyanin) (Saad et al. 2023).	MATE2 of Arabidopsis thaliana
2.A.66.1.55	"MATE drug:sodium symporter of 461 aas and 12 TMSs.  Several crystal structures are known (3VVO, 3VVP, 3VVR, 3VVS, 6FHZ, 6GWH) in several distinct apo-form conformations, and in complexes with a 
derivative of the antibacterial drug norfloxacin and three in vitro 
selected thioether-macrocyclic peptides, at 1.8 - 3.0 Å resolutions. The structures, combined with functional analyses, show that the 
protonation of Asp 41 on the N-terminal lobe induces the bending
 of TMS1, which in turn collapses the N-lobe cavity, thereby extruding 
the substrate drug to the extracellular space. Moreover, the macrocyclic
 peptides bind the central cleft in distinct manners, which correlate 
with their inhibitory activities (Tanaka et al. 2013). The  Na+-binding site, in the N-lobe of this transporter, is selective against K+, weakly specific against H+, and broadly conserved among prokaryotic MATEs (Ficici et al. 2018). The inward-facing state was obtained after crystallization in the 
presence of native lipids (Zakrzewska et al. 2019). The transition from the outward-facing state to 
the inward-facing state involves rigid body movements of TMSs 2-6 and 8-12 to form an inverted V, facilitated by a loose
 binding of TMS1 and TMS7 to their respective bundles and their 
conformational flexibility. The inward-facing structure of PfMATE in 
combination with the outward-facing one supports an alternating access 
mechanism for MATE family transporters ()Zakrzewska et al. 2019."	MOP superfamily transporter of Pyrococcus furiosus

These results have been confirmed in Daucus carota and other plants (Saad et al. 2023). A similar protein in Petunia hybrida, PhMATE1 transports antocyanins (flavanoids involved in flower color) and has 11 TMSs (Yuan et al. 2023).  Soybean oil may facilitate interactions with flavonoids to form more stable and compact fatty acid-flavonoid complexes (Fu et al. 2024).

2.A.66.1.61	Vacuolar nicotine exporter (from the cytoplasm into the vacuole), the NtMATE2 transporter, also designated the DETOXIFICATION 40-like protein, of 500 aas and 12 TMSs in a 6 + 6 TMS arrangement. NtMATE2 is located in the vacuole membrane of the tobacco plant root and is involved in the transport of nicotine, a secondary or specialized metabolic compound in Solanaceae ((Shoji et al. 2009). The crystal structures of NtMATE2 in its outward-facing forms have been determined (Tanaka et al. 2021). The overall structure has a bilobate V-shape with pseudo-symmetrical assembly of the N- and C-lobes. In one crystal structure, the C-lobe cavity of NtMATE2 interacts with an unidentified molecule that may mimic a substrate. NtMATE2-specific conformational transitions imply that an unprecedented movement of the transmembrane alpha-helix 7 (TMS7) is related to the release of the substrate into the vacuolar lumen (Tanaka et al. 2021).

function. This structural homology model suggests that MurJ functions as an essential transporter in PG biosynthesis (Butler et al. 2013). Based on an in vivo assay, MurJ is a flippase for the lipid-linked cell wall precursors, polyisoprenoid-linked disaccharide-peptapeptides (Sham et al. 2014).  There is controversy about the role of this porter and FtsW/RodA which on the basis of an in vitro assay, were thought to be flippases for the same intermediate (Young 2014). MurJ, the bacterial lipid II flippase, functions by an alternating-access mechanism (Kumar et al. 2019). The crystal structure of MurJ in a ""squeezed"" form, distinct from its inward- and outward-facing forms, has been published (Kohga et al. 2022). These authors reported two crystal structures of inward-facing forms from Arsenophonus endosymbiont MurJ and a crystal structure of E. coli MurJ in a ""squeezed"" form, which lacks a cavity to accommodate the substrate, mainly because of the increased proximity of transmembrane helices 2 and 8.

8.A.9.2.2	"The Slc3A2 (CD98hc; 4F2hc) accessory protein facilitates transport of amino acids and polyamines (putrescine/spermidine) (Uemura et al. 2008). 4F2hc stabilizes GLUT1 (2.A.1.1.28) and increase glucose transport activity (Ohno et al., 2011).  It forms a heterodimer with glycoprotein CD98 (LAT1; SLC7A5), and contributes to tumorigenesis (Estrach et al. 2014).  CD98hc also modulates integrin signaling, plays a role in cell-to-cell fusion, and is
essential for Brucella infection (Keriel et al. 2015). Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  exploits SLC3A2 for viral propagation, and upregulation of SLC3A2 may contribute to HCV-mediated pathogenesis (Nguyen et al. 2018). ZEB1, a transcriptional repressor (P37275), promotes chemoresistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells by suppressing SLC3A2 (Cui et al. 2018). SLC3A2/CD98hc and its light chain subunits constitute the heterodimeric transmembrane complexes that mediate amino acid transport and regulate MTOR and macroautophagy/autophagy (Digomann et al. 2019). It forms a tight complex with beta1 integrin (TC# 9.B.87.1.8) and TrpV4 (TC# 
1.A.4.2.5)  in focal adhesions where mechanochemical conversion takes 
place. CD98hc knock down inhibits TRPV4-mediated calcium influx induced 
by mechanical forces, but not by chemical activators, thus confirming 
the mechanospecificity of this signaling response. Molecular analysis 
revealed that forces applied to beta1 integrin must be transmitted from 
its cytoplasmic C-terminus via the CD98hc cytoplasmic tail to the 
ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV4 in order to produce ultra-rapid, 
force-induced, channel activation within the focal adhesion (Potla et al. 2020). CD98hc is an antibody drug-conjugate target in triple negative breast cancer (Montero et al. 2022). N-glycosylation is crucial for trafficking and stability of SLC3A2 (Console et al. 2022). CD98 defines a metabolically flexible, proinflammatory subset of low-density neutrophils in systemic lupus erythematosus (Martin et al. 2023).  RNA-binding protein SLC3A2 regulates melanocyte ferroptosis (Zhang et al. 2024)."

CD98hc combines with one of six CD98lc proteins to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in atherosclerosis (Baumer et al. 2017).  CD98 heavy chain is a prognostic biomarker and target for cancer treatment (Xia and Dubrovska 2023).

1.E.19.3.1	"The C. difficile holin, TcdE.  TcdE acts as a holin-like protein to facilitate the release of C. 
difficile toxins A and B to the extracellular environment, but, unlike most phage
 holins, it does not cause the non-specific release of cytosolic contents. 
TcdE is thus a bacterial holin that 
releases toxins into the environment by a phage-like system (Tan et al. 2001; Govind and Dupuy 2012).  Different isoforms have differing activities in toxin release (Govind et al. 2015). An autolysin, Cwp19 (L7PGA3), may also play a role in toxin release (El Meouche and Peltier 2018). Adaptation of this phage-derived holin/endolysin system to toxin transport has been discussed (Mehner-Breitfeld et al. 2018). Thus, TcdE exists as three isoforms, differing with respect to their N-terminal extensions.  The longest TcdE isoform has a moderate effect on cell growth, whereas 
the shortest isoform strongly induces lysis. The effect of the longest 
isoform was inhibitory for cell lysis, implying a regulatory function of
 the N-terminal 24 residues.  Mehner-Breitfeld et al. 2018 analyzed the PaLoc sequence of 44 C. difficile isolates and found that four of these encode only the short TcdE isoform, and the most closely related holins from C. difficile phages only possess one of these initiation codons, indicating that the N-terminal extensions of TcdE evolved in C. difficile."

2.A.5.1.21	Zinc-regulated zinc transporting Zrt2 of 370 aas and 8 TMSs in a 3 + 5 TMS arrangement. It contains an extra-membrane disordered loop, corresponding to the amino acid sequence 126-215. Three Zrt2+ regions in this loop bind Zn2+ and Cu2+ with comparable affinities below pH 5, and therefore, may equally contribute to metal acquisition under the most acidic conditions in which the Zrt2 transporter is expressed (Bellotti et al. 2022).

The 14 amino acid Aspf2 C-terminus coordinates Zn2+ via two Cys thiolates and two His imidazoles (Garstka et al. 2022). The Aspf2 zincophore protein is a member of the Asp F2 family (TC# 8.A.190).

A modeled ZIP4 dimer possibly resembles the twelve TMS monomeric PiPT of the MFS, as a likely structural homologue (Antala et al. 2015). Zip4 zinc transporter mutations linked to acrodermatitis enteropathica disrupt function and cause mistrafficking (Kuliyev et al. 2021). A missense variant of SLC39A4 (Zip4) is found in a litter of turkish van cats with acrodermatitis enteropathica (Kiener et al. 2021).  hZIP4 is the primary Zn2+ importer in the intestine, but it is also expressed in a variety of organs such as the pancreas and brain. It and a mutant form have been expressed in yeast (Liu et al. 2022). The transmembrane domains mediate oligomerization of the human ZIP4 transporter in vivo (Liu et al. 2022).  A ""divide and conquer"" strategy has been applied to ZIP4 to study the extracellular domain (ECD) and the transmembrane domain separately, which has led to the first ECD structure in the entire ZIP family. Duan and Zhang 2023 provided detailed protocols for the expression, purification, and crystallization of ZIP4-ECD from a mammalian species."

Also transports selenium (Liang et al. 2021). Four amino acid residues, V33, G38, S335, and I340 of hZIP8 are mutated in patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), caused by low blood Mn2+ levels (Fujishiro et al. 2022). Among the four mutations observed in ZIP8-mutated CDG patients, the S335T and I340N mutations in TMS5 abolished Mn2+- and Cd2+-transport activity, while V33M and G35R mutations did not. Artificial mutations in the metal-binding motif EEXXH in TMS5, which exists in most ZIP transporters, abolished the Mn2+- and Cd2+-transport activity of hZIP8 (Fujishiro et al. 2022). Loss of hepatic manganese transporter ZIP8 disrupts serum transferrin glycosylation and the glutamate-glutamine cycle (Powers et al. 2023).

2.A.5.5.1	Broad specificity heavy metal divalent cation uptake transporter, ZupT (Fe2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ are transported) (Grass et al., 2005). Point mutations change the specificity and kinetics of metal uptake (Taudte and Grass, 2010). Important for virulence in Salmonella (Karlinsey et al., 2010). ZupT has an asymmetric binuclear metal center in the transmembrane domain; one metal-binding site, M1, binds zinc, cadmium, and iron, while the other, M2, binds iron only and with higher affinity than M1. Using site-specific mutagenesis and transport activity measurements in whole cells and proteoliposomes, Roberts et al. 2021 showed that zinc is transported from M1, while iron is transported from M2. The two sites share a common bridging ligand, a conserved glutamate residue. M1 and M2 have ligands from highly conserved motifs in transmembrane domains 4 and 5. Additionally, M2 has a ligand from transmembrane domain 6, a glutamate residue, which is conserved in the gufA subfamily of ZIP transporters, including ZupT and the human ZIP11. Unlike cadmium, iron transport from M2 does not inhibit the zinc transport activity but slightly stimulates it. This stimulated activity is mediated through the bridging carboxylate ligand. The binuclear zinc-iron binding center in ZupT has likely evolved to enable the transport of essential metals from two different sites without competition; a similar mechanism of metal transport is likely to be found in the gufA subfamily of ZIP transporter proteins (Roberts et al. 2021).

Ca2+ leak channel (part of the γ-secretase complex; expression alters the lipid raft composition in neuronal membranes (Eckert and Müller, 2009)). The first 5 TMSs of presenilin-1 are homologous to the 5 TMS CD47 antigenic protein, a constituent of the osteoclast fusion complex (1.N.1.1.1), and CD47 is therefore a presenilin homologue.   The active site of gamma-secretase resides in an aqueous catalytic pore
 within the lipid bilayer and is tapered around the catalytic aspartates
 (Sato et al. 2006). TMS 6 and TMS 7 contribute to the hydrophilic pore.

(T7SS). The protein is
predicted to consist of an intracellular repeat of forkhead-associated (FHA) domains at the
N-terminus, two transmembrane helices and three P-loop containing ATPase-type domains, D1-3, forming
the C-terminal intracellular segment. Zoltner et al. 2016 presented crystal structures of the N-terminal FHA domains
(EssC-N) and a C-terminal fragment EssC-C from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans,
encompassing two of the ATPase-type modules, D2 and D3. Module D2 binds ATP with high affinity
whereas D3 does not. The EssC-N and EssC-C constructs are monomeric in solution but the full-length
recombinant protein, with molecular weight about 169 kDa, forms a multimer of approximately 1 MDa.
The observation of protomer contacts in the crystal structure of EssC-C together with similarity to
the DNA translocase FtsK, suggests a model for a hexameric EssC assembly. Such an observation
potentially identifies the key component of pore formation required for
secretion. The extreme C-terminal ATPase domain appears essential
for EssC activity as a key part of the T7SS whilst D2 and FHA domains are required for the
production of a stable and functional protein (Zoltner et al. 2016). TheTMSs of EssA and EssB interact, regulating secretion (Ahmed et al. 2018). This system resembles the ESX systems of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TC# 3.A.24)."	Low G+C Gram-postive bacteria

All 21 gene products are included within this TC entry although it is not established that all participate in secretion. The descriptions of the proteins are as listed in UNIPROT. Myxococcus xanthus, a soil bacterium, predates collectively using
 motility to invade prey colonies. Prey lysis is mostly thought to rely 
on secreted factors, cocktails of antibiotics and enzymes as well as direct 
contact with Myxococcus cells. Seef et al. 2021 showed that on 
surfaces, the coupling of A-motility and contact-dependent killing is the
 central predatory mechanism driving effective prey colony invasion and 
consumption. At the molecular level, contact-dependent killing involves a type IV filament-like machinery (Kil) that both 
promotes motility arrest and prey cell plasmolysis. In this process, Kil
 proteins assemble at the predator-prey contact site, suggesting that 
they allow tight contact with prey cells for their intoxication. 
Kil-like systems form a new class of Tad-like machineries in predatory 
bacteria, suggesting a conserved function in predator-prey interactions.

The crystal structure of the IcmR-IcmQ complex has been solved (Raychaudhury et al., 2009). Legionella pneumophila survives and replicates inside host cells by secreting ~300 effectors through the defective in organelle trafficking (Dot)/intracellular multiplication (Icm) type IVB secretion system (T4BSS). Ghosal et al. 2019, using electron cryotomography mapped the location of the core and accessory components of the Legionella core transmembrane subcomplex, revealing a well-ordered central channel that opens into a large, windowed secretion chamber with an unusual 13-fold symmetry. Immunofluorescence microscopy deciphered an early-stage assembly process that begins with the targeting of Dot/Icm components to the bacterial poles. Polar targeting of this T4BSS is mediated by two Dot/Icm proteins, DotU and IcmF, that are homologues of the T6SS membrane complex components TssL and TssM, suggesting that the Dot/Icm T4BSS is a hybrid system. Thus, the Dot/Icm complex assembles in an 'axial-to-peripheral' pattern (Ghosal et al. 2019).	γ-proteobacteria

Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes followed by a two-electrode voltage clamp showed an inward current that is NH4+ dependent at a resting membrane potential lower than -120 mV and is not pH dependent, suggesting that TcAMT is an NH4+or NH3/H+ transporter.

1.A.11.4.1	"Rhesus (Rh) type C glycoprotein NH3/NH4+ transporter, RhCG (also called tumor-related protein DRC2) (Bakouh et al., 2004; Worrell et al., 2007). Zidi-Yahiaoui et al. (2009) have described characteristics of the pore/vestibule.  The structure is known to 2.1 Å resolution (Gruswitz et al., 2010). Each monomer contains 12 transmembrane helices, one more than in the 
bacterial homologs. Reconstituted into proteoliposomes, RhCG conducts 
NH3 to raise the internal pH. Models of the erythrocyte Rh complex based 
on the RhCG structure suggest that the erythrocytic Rh complex is 
composed of stochastically assembled heterotrimers of RhAG, RhD, and 
RhCE (Gruswitz et al., 2010). Rh proteins also transport CO2 (Michenkova et al. 2021)."	Animals
1.A.11.4.10	RH (Rhesus) antigen-related protein, Rhr-1 or Rh1, of 463 aas and 12 TMSs.  CeRh1 is abundantly expressed in all developmental stages of C. elegans, with highest levels in adults, whereas CeRh2 shows a differential and much lower expression pattern. It is required for passage throung the late stages of C. elegans embryonic development and hypodermal function (Ji et al. 2006). Transports NH3, NH4+ and CO2 (Michenkova et al. 2021).

1.A.11.4.12	The rhesus protein, Rhp1, of 479 aas and 11 TMSs.  Reef-building corals maintain an intracellular photosymbiotic association with dinoflagellate algae. As the algae are hosted inside the symbiosome, all metabolic exchanges must take place across the symbiosome membrane. Thies et al. 2022 established that Acropora yongei Rh (ayRhp1) facilitates transmembrane NH3 and CO2 diffusion, and that it is present in the symbiosome membrane. Furthermore, ayRhp1 abundance in the symbiosome membrane was highest around midday and lowest around midnight. Probably ayRhp1 mediates a symbiosomal NH4+-trapping mechanism that promotes nitrogen delivery to algae during the day - necessary to sustain photosynthesis-and restrict nitrogen delivery at night-to keep the algae under nitrogen limitation (Thies et al. 2022).

Other substrates include TPP, TMP and pyrithiamin with nM binding constants at 1:1 stoichiometry (protein:ligand). Binding depends on a tryptophan-rich loop between TMSs 5 and 6 (Erkens and Slotboom, 2010). Erkens et al. (2011) presented the crystal structure of the thiamine-specific S-component of the ECF-type ABC transporter, ThiT from Lactococcus lactis at 2.0 Å. Extensive protein-substrate interactions explain its high binding affinity for thiamine (Kd ~ 10-10 M). ThiT has a fold similar to that of the riboflavin-specific S-component RibU, with which it shares only 14% sequence identity. Two alanines in a conserved motif (AxxxA) located on the membrane-embedded surface of the S-components mediate the interaction with the energizing module. A general transport mechanism for ECF transporters has been proposed (Erkens et al., 2011).  Substrate binding induces conformational changes in ThiT (Majsnerowska et al. 2013).	Firmicutes

2.A.28.1.2	"Liver/ileal bile acid:Na+ symporter, ASBT, ISBT or NTCP2 (SLC10A2) of 348 aas and 7 TMSs (Mareninova et al. 2005) (essential for liver or intestinal bile acid transport and homeostasis (Rao et al., 2008). This BART superfamily protein has been modeled in 3-dimensions using the 3-D structure of bacteriorhodopsin (a TOG superfamily member) (Zhang et al. 2004). TMS4 forms part of the substrate translocation pathway (Khantwal and Swaan, 2008); TMS7 plays a role in substrate binding and translocation (González et al., 2012); TMS1 contributes to substrate translocation and protein stability (da Silva et al., 2011), and TMS2 coordinates Na+ translocation (Sabit et al. 2013).  NTCP serves as the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) receptor, and drugs developed to target NTCP induce autophagy and may provide therapy for HBV (Zhang et al. 2015). Decreased activity leads to luminal bile salt concentrations and either increased eletrolyte secretion or decreased reabsolption (van der Mark et al., 2014). Function and stability depend on N-glycosylation (Muthusamy et al. 2015).  Specific inhibitors are known (Slijepcevic and van de Graaf 2017). It has a 7 TMS topology (Banerjee and Swaan 2006). Chronic hepatitis B, C and D viruses (HBV, HCV and HDV) infect the liver and cause cancer. The three viruses are exclusively 
hepatotropic, and NTCP mediates the transport of bile acids and plays a key role in HBV HCV and HDV entry into hepatocytes. It modulates HCV infection 
by regulating innate antiviral immune responses in the liver (Eller et al. 2018). The S-acylation status of hASBT regulates its function, metabolic stability, membrane expression, and phosphorylation state (Ayewoh et al. 2020). The GXXXG/A motifs in TMS2 and  TMS7 are important for proper folding and sorting of NTCP, and they indirectly affect glycosylation, homodimerization, and bile acid transport, as well as its HBV/HDV receptor function (Palatini et al. 2021). Structural plasticity is a feature of rheostat positions in the human Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) (Ruggiero et al. 2022). A monoclonal antibody against human NTCP blocks Hepatitis B virus infection (Takemori et al. 2022). NTCP interacts directly with the first 48 amino acid residues of the N-myristoylated N-terminal preS1 domain of the hepatitis viral large protein. 3-d structural analyses suggest that members of the SLC10 family share a common mechanism  of bile acid transport, but the NTCP structure displays an additional pocket formed by residues that are known to interact with preS1 (Park et al. 2022). Genetic variants of NTCP gene influence hepatitis B vaccine failure (Chen et al. 2022).  Enhanced oral absorption and liver distribution of polymeric nanoparticles can be achieved through traveling the enterohepatic circulation pathways of bile acids using ASBT (Wang et al. 2022)."

Asp124 may play a critical role by allowing Na+-induced conformational changes and sugar binding. Asp19 may facilitate melibiose binding (Granell et al., 2010).  The alternate access mechanism fits better into a flexible gating mechanism rather than the archetypical helical rigid-

cosubstrate-binding sites are mainly contributed by the residues from 
the amino-terminal domain (Ethayathulla et al. 2014).

2.A.2.3.8	"Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain containing 2A, MFSD2A or SLC59A1 (543aas, 12 TMSs). It is the omega-3-fatty acid transporter that plays a role in thermogenesis via β-adrenergic signaling. Takes up Tunicamycin (TM), a mixture of related species of nucleotide sugar analogs fatty-acylated with alkyl chains of varying lengths and degrees of unsaturation, produced by several Streptomyces species (Bassik and Kampmann, 2011; Reiling et al., 2011).  It is a sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) symporter expressed at the blood-brain barrier
endothelium. It is the primary route for import of docosahexaenoic acid and other long-chain
fatty acids into foetal and adult brain, and is essential for mouse and human brain growth and
function (Quek et al. 2016). In addition to a conserved
sodium-binding site, three structural features were identified: A phosphate headgroup binding
site, a hydrophobic cleft to accommodate a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail, and three sets of ionic
locks that stabilize the outward-open conformation. Ligand docking studies and biochemical assays
identified Lys436 as a key residue for transport. It forms a salt bridge with the negative
charge on the phosphate headgroup. Mfsd2a transports structurally related
acylcarnitines but not a lysolipid without a negative charge, demonstrating the necessity of a
negative charged headgroup interaction with Lys436 for transport. These findings support a novel
transport mechanism by which LPCs are flipped within the transporter cavity by pivoting about Lys436
leading to net transport from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Quek et al. 2016). Docosahexaenoic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid that is essential for neurological development and function, and it is supplied to the brain and eyes predominantly from dietary sources. This nutrient is transported across the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers as lysophosphatidylcholine. The structure of MFSD2A has been determined using single-particle cryo-EM (Cater et al. 2021). The transporter is in an inward-facing conformation and features a large amphipathic cavity that contains the Na+-binding site and a bound lysolipid substrate. This structure reveals details of how MFSD2A interacts with substrates and how Na+-dependent conformational changes allow for the release of these substrates into the membrane through a lateral gate. This atypical MFS transporter mediates the uptake of lysolipids into the brain. Homozygous variants in the MFSD2A gene cause severe primary microcephaly, brain malformations, developmental delay, and epilepsy (Khuller et al. 2021). Bi-allelic MFSD2A variants cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly type 15 and broaden the phenotypic spectrum associated with these pathogenic variants, emphasizing the role of MFSD2A in early brain development. Substrate binding-induced conformational transitions in the omega-3 fatty acid transporter MFSD2A have been documented (Bergman et al. 2023)."	Animals

characterized by reduced biosynthesis of melanin pigmentation in skin, hair and eyes.
The MATP protein consists of 530 amino acids which contains 12 TMSs (Kamaraj and Purohit 2016).  The D93N mutation causes oculocutaneous albinism 4 (OCA4), and the L374F mutatioin

Its upregulated expression is observed in melanomas, and elevated MFSD12 levels promote cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression (Wei et al. 2019). MFSD12 interference inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in melanoma. It mediates the import of cysteine into melanosomes and lysosomes (Adelmann et al. 2020). MFSD12 is required to maintain normal levels of cystine - the oxidized dimer of cysteine - in melanosomes, and to produce cysteinyldopas, the precursors of pheomelanin synthesis made in melanosomes via cysteine oxidation. MFSD12 is necessary for the import of cysteine into melanosomes and, in non-pigmented cells, lysosomes. Loss of MFSD12 reduced the accumulation of cystine in lysosomes of fibroblasts from patients with cystinosis, a lysosomal-storage disease caused by inactivation of the lysosomal cystine exporter, cystinosin (TC# 2.A.43.1.1). Thus, MFSD12 is an essential component of the cysteine importer for melanosomes and lysosomes (Adelmann et al. 2020).	MFSD12 of Homo sapiens

Free amino acids, omega-amino fatty acidss, and peptides with

 amino-acid transporter that mediates the transmembrane transport of 
L-histidine and some di- and tripeptides from inside the lysosome to the
 cytosol, and plays a key role in innate immune responses (Bhardwaj et al. 2006, Kobayashi et al. 2014, Song et al. 2018). It is able to transport a variety of di- and tripeptides, including carnosine and some peptidoglycans (Song et al. 2018; Oppermann et al. 2019). Transport activity is pH-dependent and maximized in the acidic lysosomal environment. It is involved in the detection of microbial pathogens by toll-like receptors
 (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), probably by mediating transport 
of bacterial peptidoglycans across the endolysosomal membrane: it catalyzes
 the transport of certain bacterial peptidoglycans, such as muramyl 
dipeptide, the NOD2 ligand, and 
L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate (tri-DAP), the 
NOD1 ligand (Kobayashi et al. 2014, Song et al. 2018). Byrnes et al. 2022 reviewed three specific mechanisms by which autophagy can regulate metabolism: A) nutrient regeneration, B) quality control of organelles, and C) signaling protein regulation. PHT1 is a histidine/oligopeptide transporter with an essential role in 
Toll-like receptor innate immune responses. It can act as a receptor by 
recruiting the adaptor protein TASL which leads to type I interferon 
production via IRF5 (Custódio et al. 2023). Persistent stimulation of this signalling pathway 
is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). The authors 
presented the Cryo-EM structure of PHT1 stabilized in the outward-open 
conformation and proposed a model of the PHT1-TASL complex, in which the 
first 16 N-terminal TASL residues fold into a helical structure that 
bind in the central cavity of the inward-open conformation of PHT1. This
 work suggests the molecular basis of PHT1/TASL 
mediated type I interferon production (Custódio et al. 2023)."	Animals

In contrast to most NRT1 transporters, NRT1.13 does not have the conserved proline residue between TMSs 10 and 11, an essential residue for nitrate transport activity in CHL1/NRT1.1/NPF6.3 ( TC# 2.A.17.3.1). NRT1.13 showed no nitrate transport activity, but when Ser487 at the corresponding position was converted to proline, NRT1.13 S487P gained nitrate uptake activity, suggesting that wild-type NRT1.13 cannot transport nitrate but can bind it (Chen et al. 2021). Subcellular localization  indicated that NRT1.13 is a plasma membrane protein expressed at the parenchyma cells next to xylem in the petioles and the stem nodes. When plants were grown with a normal concentration of nitrate, the nrt1.13 mutant showed no severe growth phenotype, but when grown under low-nitrate conditions, nrt1.13 showed delayed flowering, increased node number, retarded branch outgrowth, and reduced lateral nitrate allocation to nodes. This suggested that NRT1.13 is required for low-nitrate acclimation and that internal nitrate is monitored near the xylem by NRT1.13 to regulate shoot architecture and flowering time.

2.A.17.4.1	"Peptide:H+ symporter (transports cationic, neutral and anionic dipeptides including glycylsarcosine (gly-sar) (Søndergaard et al., 2008) as well as anserine (β-alanyl-1-N-methyl-L-histidine) and carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) (Geissler et al., 2010); also transports β-lactam antibiotics, the antitumor agent, bestatin, and various protease inhibitors). It is competitively inhibited by L-4,4'-biphenylalanyl-L-proline (Bip-Pro) with ~10-20µM affinity. Inhibitors/substrates include cefadroxil, Ala-4-nitroanilide and δ-aminolevulinic acid (Knutter et al., 2007). The intracellular loop linking transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of the human dipeptide transporter hPEPT1 includes two amphipathic alpha-helices, with net positive and negative charges which interact and influence conformational changes of hPEPT1 during and after glycylsarcosine transport (Xu et al., 2010).  The rabbit orthologue provides the main pathway for dietary nitrogen uptake. Five tyrosyl residues are important for function and/or substrate binding (Pieri et al. 2009).  Human PepT1 is modified by N-glycosylation, and all six asparagine residues in the
large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 9 and 10 are subject to N-glycosylation (Chan et al. 2016). Lat1 transports 26 biologically active ultrashort peptides (USPs) into cells as is also true of LAT2 and
 PEPT1 (Khavinson et al. 2023). The sizes and structures of 
ligand-binding sites of the amino acid transporters LAT1, LAT2, and of 
the peptide transporter PEPT1 are sufficient for the transport of the 26
 biologically active di-, tri-, and tetra-peptides. Comparative analyses
 of the binding of all possible di- and tri-peptides (8400 compounds) at
 the binding sites of the LAT and PEPT family transporters was considered (Khavinson et al. 2023). The 26 biologically active USPs systematically showed 
higher binding scores to LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1, as compared with di- and
 tri-peptides. Most of 
the 26 studied USPs were found to bind to the LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1 
transporters more efficiently than the previously known substrates or inhibitors of
 these transporters. Peptides ED, DS, DR, EDR, EDG, AEDR, AEDL, KEDP, 
and KEDG, and peptoids DS7 and KE17 with negatively charged Asp- or Glu- amino acid residues at the N-terminus and neutral or positively charged
 residues at the C-terminus of the peptide were found to be the most 
effective ligands of the transporters under investigation. It can be 
assumed that the antitumor effect of the KE, EW, EDG, and AEDG peptides 
could be associated with their ability to inhibit the LAT1, LAT2, and 
PEPT1 amino acid transporters (Khavinson et al. 2023)."	Animals

Inhibitor/substrates includes cefadroxil, Ala-4-nitroanilide and delta-aminolevulinic acid (Knutter et al., 2007).  It transports the fluorescent tracer-dipeptide beta-Ala-Lys-Nepsilon-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin-3-acetic acid (Ala-Lys-AMCA). Whole-mount preparations from mouse, rat, and guinea pig stomach and small and large intestine were incubated with Ala-Lys-AMCA in the presence or absence of the uptake-inhibitors L-histidine, D-phenylalanyl-L-alanine (D-Phe-Ala), glycyl-L-sarcosine (Gly-Sar), glycyl-L-glutamine (Gly-Gln), benzylpenicillin, and cefadroxil. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Ala-Lys-AMCA specifically accumulated in both ganglionic layers of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in all regions and species studied (Rühl et al. 2005). This could be inhibited by Gly-Sar, D-Phe-Ala, Gly-Gln, and cefadroxil, but not by free histidine and benzylpenicillin, indicating uptake via PEPT2. Accordingly, dipeptide uptake was completely abolished in PEPT2-deficient mice.	Animals

2.A.17.4.8	"Solute carrier family 15 member 2 (Kidney H+:peptide cotransporter) (Oligopeptide transporter, kidney isoform) (Peptide transporter 2, PEPT2) (Verri et al. 2016). Transports opioid peptides (Ganapathy and Miyauchi 2005). It is an electrogenic uphill peptide and peptidomimetic drug transporter, coupling of substrate translocation to a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient serving as the driving force. In human airways, PEPT2 is localized to bronchial epithelium and alveolar type II pneumocytes, and transport studies revealed that both peptides and peptidomimetic drugs such as antibiotic, antiviral, and antineoplastic drugs are carried by the system. PEPT2 is also responsible for the transport of delta-aminolevulinic acid, which is used for photodynamic therapy and the diagnostics of pulmonary neoplasms (Groneberg et al. 2004). PepT2 in mammals plays essential roles in the 
reabsorption and conservation of peptide-bound amino acids in the kidney
 and in maintaining neuropeptide homeostasis in the brain. It is also responsible for the absorption 
and disposing of peptide-like drugs, including angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, β-lactam antibiotics and antiviral prodrugs. 
Understanding the structure, function and regulation of PepT2 is of 
emerging interest in nutrition, medical and pharmacological research. Wang et al. 2022 provided an overview of the structure, 
substrate preferences and localizations of PepT2 in mammals. As PepT2 is 
expressed in various organs, its functions in the liver, kidney, brain, 
heart, lung and mammary gland have been addressed. Regulatory factors that affect the expression and function of PepT2, 
such as transcriptional activation and posttranslational modification, 
are also discussed (Wang et al. 2022)."	Animals

 with a preference for dipeptides, a major route for the 
absorption of protein digestion end-products. PepT1 is modified by N-glycosylation, and all six asparagine residues in the
large extracellular loop between TMSs 9 and 10 are subject to N-glycosylation.  This allows proper association with the plasma membrane and/or stabilization (Chan et al. 2016). Transports opioid peptides (Ganapathy and Miyauchi 2005), can serve as a druh importer and plays a role in inflammatory bowel diseases (Viennois et al. 2018). PEPT1 is upregulated in kidney cancer cell lines, with little expression in normal pancreas. PEPT1 is essential for the growth of pancreatic cancer cells and is therefore a viable drug target (Schniers et al. 2021). Mutation of arginine 282 to glutamate uncouples the movement of peptides 
and protons by the rabbit PepT1 (Meredith 2004). The structure of the horse ortholog shows that the extracellular domain between TMSs 9 and 10 bridges the NTD and CTD by interacting with TMS1. Deletion of ECD or mutations to the ECD-TMS1 interface impairs transport activity (Shen et al. 2022)."	Animals

4.D.1.1.10	The hyaluronan (hyaluronate) synthase1/exporter, HAS1 of 578 aas and 6 or 7 TMSs in a 1 or 2 TMS(s) (N-terminal) + 5 TMSs (C-terminal) arrangement. Hyaluronan is an acidic heteropolysaccharide comprising alternating N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronate residues that is ubiquitously expressed in the vertebrate extracellular matrix. The high-molecular-mass polymer modulates essential physiological processes in health and disease, including cell differentiation, tissue homeostasis and angiogenesis (Maloney et al. 2022). Hyaluronan is synthesized by a membrane-embedded processive glycosyltransferase, hyaluronan synthase (HAS), which catalyses the synthesis and membrane translocation of hyaluronan from uridine diphosphate-activated precursors. Maloney et al. 2022 described five cryo-EM structures of a viral HAS homologue in different states during substrate binding and initiation of polymer synthesis. HAS selects its substrates, hydrolyses the first substrate to prime the synthesis reaction, opens a hyaluronan-conducting transmembrane channel, ensures alternating substrate polymerization and coordinates hyaluronan inside its transmembrane pore. A detailed model for the formation of an acidic extracellular heteropolysaccharide is proposed that provides insights into the biosynthesis of one of the most abundant and essential glycosaminoglycans in the human body (Maloney et al. 2022).

4.D.1.1.12	Chitin synthase 3, Chs3, of 1165 aas and 7 TMSs in a 2 + 1 + 4 TMS arrangement. Chitin biosynthesis in yeast is accomplished by three chitin synthases (Chs) termed Chs1 (TC# 4.D.1.1.17), Chs2 (TC# 4.D.1.1.16) and Chs3, the last which accounts for most of the chitin deposited within the cell wall. While the overall structures of Chs1 and Chs2 are similar to those of other chitin synthases from fungi and arthropods, Chs3 lacks some of the C-terminal transmembrane helices raising questions regarding its structure and topology. Gohlke et al. 2017 determined aspects of the catalytic domain, the chitin-translocating channel and the interfacial helices in between. They identified an amphipathic, crescent-shaped alpha-helix attached to the inner side of the membrane that may control the channel entrance and a finger helix pushing the polymer into the channel. Chitin synthases form oligomeric complexes, which may be necessary for the formation of chitin nanofibrils. They detected oligomeric complexes at the bud neck, the lateral plasma membrane, and in membranes of Golgi vesicles (Gohlke et al. 2017). The combined action of two independent but redundant endocytic recycling mechanisms, together with distinct labels for vacuolar degradation, determines the final fate of the intracellular traffic of the Chs3 protein, allowing yeast cells to regulate morphogenesis, depending on environmental constraints (Arcones et al. 2016).

2.A.40.1.1	Uracil permease, UraA. The crystal structure of UraA with bound uracil at 2.8 Å resolution is available (PDB: 3QE7) (Lu et al., 2011). UraA has a novel structural fold, with 14 TMSs divided into two inverted repeats. A pair of antiparallel β-strands is located between TMS3 and TMS10 and has an important role in structural organization and substrate recognition. The structure is spatially arranged into a core domain and a gate domain. Uracil, located at the interface between the two domains, is coordinated mainly by residues from the core domain. Structural analysis suggests that alternating access of the substrate may be achieved through conformational changes of the gate domain.  Multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of the UraA symporter in phospholipid bilayers revealed a closed state with 3 high affinity binding sites for cardolipin (Kalli et al. 2015).The crystal structure of UraA bound to uracil in an occluded state at 2.5 A resolution (Yu et al. 2017). UraA shows substantial motions between the core domain and the gate domain as well as intra-domain rearrangements of the gate domain.

2.A.40.4.1	"High affinity uric acid-xanthine permease, UapA. Functionaly critical residues in transmembrane segments 1 and 3 have been identified (Amillis et al., 2011). The substrate recognition and transport pathway have been proposed (Kosti et al., 2012; Kosti et al. 2010).  UapA oligomerization
is essential for membrane trafficking and turnover and is a common theme in fungi and mammalian
cells (Martzoukou et al. 2015).  Specificity is determined by the interactions of a given
substrate with the TMS8-9 loop and by interactions of this loop with TMS1 and TMS12 (Papageorgiou et al. 2008). F528 and Q408 in TMS 12 are important for substrate recognition, and mutation of the former results in high efficiency uptake of several purines and pyrimidines not otherwise transported (Vlanti et al. 2006). A high resolution structure of UapA is available, and it is formed 
from two domains, a core domain and a gate domain, similar to the 
previously solved uracil transporter UraA, which belongs to the same 
family (Alguel et al. 2016). The structure shows UapA in an inward-facing conformation with xanthine bound to residues in the
 core domain. Unlike UraA, which is a monomer, UapA forms a dimer in the crystals with dimer interactions formed 
exclusively through the gate domain. Analysis of dominant negative 
mutants is consistent with dimerization playing a key role in transport. Alguel et al. 2016 postulated that UapA uses an elevator transport mechanism likely to be shared with other 
structurally homologous transporters including anion exchangers and 
prestin. Specific residues in UapA are critical for dimerization, ER-exit and function (Kourkoulou et al. 2019). Despite structural and functional differences, all elevator-type transporters use a common mechanism of substrate translocation via reversible movements of a mobile core domain (the elevator) hosting the substrate binding site along a rigid scaffold domain stably anchored in the plasma membrane via homodimerization (Dimakis et al. 2022). One of the best studied elevator transporters is the UapA uric acid-xanthine/H+ symporter of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. TMSs 5 and 12 in UapA control, negatively or positively, the dynamics of transport as well as substrate binding affinity and specificity. Mutations in TMS5 can lead to increased rate of transport, but also to an inactive transporter due to high-affinity substrate-trapping, whereas mutations in TMS12 lead to apparently uncontrolled sliding and broadened specificity, leading in specific cases to UapA-mediated purine toxicity.  The interactome of the UapA transporter revealed putative new players in anterograde membrane cargo trafficking(Georgiou et al. 2023)."

An ""ancestral"" homolog (AncXanQ) has been constructed and proved to have broader specificity, transporting with high-affinity both xanthine and guanine, but also recognizing adenine, hypoxanthine, and a range of analogs (Tatsaki et al. 2021). AncXanQ conserves all binding-site residues of XanQ and differs substantially in only five intramembrane residues outside the binding site. Tatsaki et al. 2021 subjected both homologs to rationally designed mutagenesis and presented evidence that these five residues are linked with the specificity changes."

Truncation of Alr1 showed that the N-terminal 239 amino acids and the C-terminal 53 amino acids are not essential for magnesium uptake (Lee and Gardner 2006). Mutations in  the C-terminal part of ALR1 that is homologous to bacterial CorA magnesium transporters that gave severe phenotypes had amino acid changes in the small region containing the TMSs. Eighteen single amino acid mutants in this region were classified into three categories for magnesium uptake: no, low and moderate activity. Conservative mutations that reduced or inactivated uptake led to the identification of Ser(729), Ile(746) and Met(762) (part of the conserved GMN motif) as critical residues. High expression of inactive mutants inhibited the capability of wild-type Alr1 to transport magnesium, consistent with Alr1 forming homo-oligomers (Lee and Gardner 2006). Alr1 may play a role in cadmium resistance (Kern et al. 2005).	Yeast

Archaea
1.A.35.3.2	"Magnesium transport protein, CorA.  The structure at 2.7 Å resolution is known. The CorA monomer has a C-terminal membrane domain containing two transmembrane segments and a large N-terminal cytoplasmic soluble domain. In the membrane, CorA forms a homopentamer shaped like a funnel which binds fully hydrated Mg2+ in the periplasm (Maguire 2006). A ring of positive charges are external to the ion-conduction pathway at the cytosolic membrane interface, and highly negatively charged helices in the cytosolic domain  appear to interact with the ring of positive charge to facilitate Mg2+ entry. Mg2+ ions are present in the cytosolic domain that are well placed to control the interaction of the ring of positive charge and the negatively charged helices, and thus, control Mg2+ entry (Maguire 2006).  Gating is achieved by helical rotation upon the binding of a metal ion
 substrate to the regulatory binding sites. The preference  for Co2+ over Mg2+ has been reported to be determined by the presence of threonine side chains in the channel (Nordin et al. 2013), but more recently, Kowatz and Maguire 2018 showed that Co2+ is not a substrate, and that the intersubunit bound Mg2+ is not required for function and does not control the open versus closed states."

Other nucleotides bound, but only ATP bound with high affinity and changed the conformation of KtrA so that KtrA and KtrB associate (Kroning et al., 2007) in vivo. Both ATP and ΔΨ were required for transport activity. K+ uptake may occur by a Na+:K+ symport mechanism.  However, one region of KtrB, the transmembrane helix (M(2C); 40aas long) seems to control K+ transport non-coordinately with Na+ symport (Haenelt et al., 2010).

1.A.26.1.2	The Mg2+ transporter, MgtE. The crystal structure of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain has been determined to 2.3 Å resolution (Hattori et al., 2007) (>50% identical to 9.A.19.1.1), while the C-terminal transmembrane domain has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution (Takeda et al. 2014). The structure reveals a homodimer with the channel at the interface of the two subunits.  There is a plug helix connecting the two domains, and the cytoplasmic domain possesses multiple Mg2+ binding sites at the cytoplasmic face that can bind Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ca2+. Dissociation of Mg2+ ions from the cytoplasmic domain induces structural changes in the cytoplasmic domain, leading to channel opening (Wang et al. 2023). Novel crystal structures of the Mg2+-bound MgtE cytoplasmic domains from two different bacterial species, Chryseobacterium hispalense and Clostridiales bacterium allowed identification of multiple Mg2+ binding sites, including ones that were not observed in the previous MgtE structure.

2.A.19.3.1	The 10 TMS cardiac Ca2+:3 Na+  antiporter, NCX1 (Ren and Philipson 2013).  The Ca2+ sensor (residues 371-508) binds cytoplasmic Ca2+ allosterically to activate exchange activity)  (Nicoll et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2006) NCX1 forms homodimers (Ren et al., 2008). It is present in mitochondria where it catalyzes Ca2+ efflux. TMS packing has been analyzed by Ren et al. (2010). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates the dimeric NCX by binding to two adjacent Ca2+-binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2) located in the large intracellular loop between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. John et al. (2011) showed that Ca2+decreases the distance between the cytoplasmic loops of NCX pairs, thereby activating transport.  Ser110 in TMS2 plays a role in both Na+ and Ca2+ transport (Ottolia and Philipson 2013). nimodipiine-sensitive NCX1, as well as mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, plays an important role in clearing somatic Ca2+ after depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx in SCN neurons (Wang et al. 2015). Regulation in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons has been studied (Cheng et al. 2018).  Genetic knockout and pharmacologic inhibitors of NCX1 attenuate hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (Nagata et al. 2020). The main Na+ influx pathway in myocardia in neonates is the NCX transporter (Oshiyama et al. 2022).  Cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ allosterically regulate Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) proteins to vary the NCX-mediated Ca2+ entry/exit rates in diverse mammalian cell types (Giladi et al. 2024).	Animals
2.A.19.3.2	Probable Ca2+:3Na+ antiporter, Calx (contains two repeat motifs Calx-α and Calxβ, between the two transmembrane domains, as is true of many Ca2+:Na+ antiporters (Schwarz and Benzer, 1997). CALX activity is inhibited by Ca2+ interaction within its two intracellular Ca2+ regulatory domains CBD1 and CBD2. The Ca2+ inhibition of CALX is achieved by interdomain conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding at CBD1 (Wu et al., 2011). The exchanger is an essential Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in excitable cells. It consists of a transmembrane domain and a large intracellular loop that contains the two Ca2+-binding domains, CBD1 and CBD2 (de Souza Degenhardt et al. 2021). The two CBDs are adjacent to each other and form a two-domain Ca2+ sensor called CBD12. Binding of intracellular Ca2+ to CBD12 activates NCX but inhibits the NCX of Drosophila, CALX. CALX and NCX CBD12 constructs display interdomain flexibility in the apo state but assume rigid interdomain arrangements in the Ca2+-bound state. CALX-CBD12 preferentially samples closed conformations, whereas the wide-open interdomain arrangement, characteristic of the Ca2+-bound state, is less frequently sampled. These results are consistent with the view that Ca2+ binding shifts the CBD12 conformational ensemble toward extended conformers, which could be a key step in the NCXs' allosteric regulation mechanism (de Souza Degenhardt et al. 2021).	Animals
2.A.19.3.3	Plasma membrane sodium:calcium exchanger, NCX3, NAC3 or SLC8A3, controlling Ca2+ homeostasis. Extrudes 1 Ca2+ for 3 extracellular Na+ ions.  Potent inhibitors have been identified (Secondo et al. 2015). One such inhibitor of NCX transporters, ORM-10962, exhibits high efficacy and selectivity.  Selective NCX inhibition can exert positive as well as negative inotropic effects, depending on the actual operation mode of the NCX (Kohajda et al. 2016). Bepridil is a commonly used medication for arrhythmia and heart failure. It primarily exerts hemodynamic effects by inhibiting Na+/K+ movement and regulating Na+/Ca2+ exchange (Wei et al. 2022).	Animals
2.A.19.3.4	"Sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (Na+/Ca2+-exchange protein 1), CNC NCX1 of 973 aas and 12 TMSs in a 6 + 6 TMS arrangement.  The cardiac isoform, CAX1.1, like the archaeal homologues for which high resolution 3-d structures are available (TC#s 2.A.19.5.3 and 2.A.19.8.2), have two aqueous ion permeation channels with cavities that can face the cytoplasm or the external medium (John et al. 2013). It exchanges one Ca2+ ion against three to four Na+ ions, and thereby contributes to the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and Ca2+-dependent cellular processes (Komuro et al. 1992; , Van Eylen et al. 2001; Kofuji et al. 1992). It also contributes to Ca2+ transport during excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. In a first 
phase, voltage-gated channels mediate the rapid increase of cytoplasmic 
Ca2+ levels due to release of Ca2+ stores from the endoplasmic reticulum. SLC8A1 mediates the export of Ca2+ from the cell during the next phase, so that cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels rapidly return to baseline. It is also required for normal embryonic heart development and the onset of heart contractions. Both NCX1 and NCX2 play important roles in the motility of the gastric fundus, ileum and
distal colon (Nishiyama et al. 2016). An amphipathic α-helix in the NCX1 large intracellular loop controls NCX1 palmitoylation. Thus, NCX1 palmitoylation is governed by a distal secondary structure element rather than by local primary sequence (Plain et al. 2017). The anti-aging gene NM_026333 contributes to proton-induced aging via the NCX1-pathway (Osanai et al. 2018). Dynamic palmitoylation modulates its structure, affinity for lipid-ordered domains, and inhibition by XIP (Gök et al. 2020). Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, and canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) are recruited by STIM1 to mediate Store-Operated Calcium Entry in primary cortical neurons (Tedeschi et al. 2022). SEA0400 is a potent and selective Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) inhibitor (Iwamoto et al. 2004).  Along the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the kidney, Ca2+ and Na+ transport occur in parallel, but those processes were dissociated in the distal convoluted tubule (Hakimi et al. 2023). Xue et al. 2023 presented cryo-EM structures of human cardiac NCX1 in both inactivated and activated states, elucidating key structural elements important for NCX ion exchange and its modulation by cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+. They showed that the interactions between the ion-transporting transmembrane (TM) domain and the cytosolic regulatory domain define the activity of NCX. In the inward-facing state with low cytosolic [Ca2+], a TM-associated four-stranded beta-hub mediates tight packing between the TM and cytosolic domains, resulting in the formation of a stable inactivation assembly that blocks the TM movement required for ion exchange. Ca2+ binding to the cytosolic second Ca2+-binding domain (CBD2) disrupts this inactivation assembly which releases its constraint on the TM domain, yielding an active exchanger. Thus, the NCX1 structures provide an essential framework for the mechanistic understanding of the ion transport and cellular regulation of NCX family proteins (Xue et al. 2023).  Structural insight into the allosteric inhibition of human sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1 by XIP and SEA0400 have been published (Dong et al. 2024).  The cryo-EM structure of NCX1.3 in the presence of a specific inhibitor, SEA0400 shows that conserved ion-coordinating residues are exposed on the cytoplasmic face of NCX1.3, indicating that the observed structure is stabilized in an inward-facing conformation. The regulatory calcium-binding domains (CBDs) assemble with the ion-translocation transmembrane domain (TMD). The exchanger-inhibitory peptide (XIP) is trapped within a groove between the TMD and CBD2 and is predicted to clash with gating helices TMs(1/6) at the outward-facing state, thus hindering the conformational transition and promoting inactivation of the transporter. A bound SEA0400 molecule stiffens helix TM2ab and affects conformational rearrangements of TM2ab that are associated with the ion-exchange reaction, thus allosterically attenuating Ca2+-uptake activity of NCX1.3 (Dong et al. 2024)."

in Na+ and Ca+ reabsorption in the kidney (Gotoh et al. 2015).  However NCX1-3 are present in the brain where they influence stroke theraputic strategies in a NCX subtype-specific fashion (Shenoda 2015). NCX1 and NCX2 play important roles in the motility of the gastric fundus, ileum and

2.A.19.4.2	The major neuronal Ca2+ + K+:4 Na+ antiporter, NCKX2. NCKX1 and NCKX2 operate with 4Na+:1Ca2++1 K+ stoichiometry; both are bidirectional transporters normally extruding Ca2+ from the cell (forward exchange), but also able to carry Ca2+ into the cell (reverse exchange) when the transmembrane Na+ gradient is reversed. Sequence changes have been observed for both NCKX1 and NCKX2 in patients with retinal diseases (Schnetkamp 2004).	Animals

2.A.19.4.4	"K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ antiporter, NCKX6 (Cai and Lytton, 2004). CCKX6 (NCLX) is an essential component of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (Palty et al., 2010; Drago et al., 2011).  It usually mediates mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion (De Marchi et al. 2014). However, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (MCU) and mitochondrial Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX, mediate Ca2+ entry into and release from this organelle and couple cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ fluctuations with cellular energetics (Verkhratsky et al. 2017). Abnormal levels occur in plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles of

2.A.19.5.3	"Na+:Ca2+ exchanger, NCX_Mj (3-d structure known at 1.9 Å resolution; PDB# 3V5U (Liao et al., 2012). Contains 10 TMSs with two 5 TMS repeats. Four ion binding sites near the center of the protein are present, one specific for Ca2+ and three probably for Na+. Two passageways allow for Na+ and Ca2+ access from the external side.  However see a more recent analysis reported for 2.A.19.8.2 (Nishizawa et al. 2013).  Transport
of both Na+ and Ca2+ requires protonation of D240, but this side chain does not coordinate
either ion, implying that the ion exchange stoichiometry is 3:1 and
that translocation of Na+ across the membrane is electrogenic although transport of Ca2+ is not (Marinelli et al. 2014). This system has been reviewed and considered to be a model protein for the entire family (Khananshvili 2021)."	Archaea

2.A.36.1.1	Na+:H+  antiporter 1 (Nhe-1) (Regulated by Daxx (O35613)). An integral membrane protein that regulates intracellular pH and has a large N-terminal membrane domain of 12 transmembrane segments and an intracellular C-terminal regulatory domain (Reddy et al., 2008). The dimer catalyzes antiport with 2Na+/2H+  stoichiometry (Fuster et al., 2008). Nedd4-1 and β-arrestin-1 are key regulators of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 ubiquitylation, endocytosis and function (Simonin and Fuster et al., 2010). Important in heart disease and cancer. Structural studies have been performed using NMR (Lee et al., 2011). Analyses of heart disease and the involvement of cell regulatory systems have been proposed (Li et al. 2023).	Animals

2.A.36.1.12	Na+:H+ antiporter, NHX1; (vacuolar/endosomal Na+ tolerance protein).  Plays roles in ion homeostasis and vesicle trafficing (Mukherjee et al. 2006). The structures and functions of these NHX homologues have been reviewed (Dutta and Fliegel 2018). K+ influx/efflux regulates mitochondrial energetics while maintaining mitochondrial ionic balance and volume homeostasis (Malas et al. 2022).	Yeast; plants
2.A.36.1.13	"Na+ /H+  exchanger-1 (NHE1).  Stoichiometry = 1:1. TMS VI of NHE1 is a discontinuous pore-lining helix with residues Asn(227), Ile(233), and Leu(243) lining the translocation pore (Tzeng et al., 2010). (orthologous to NHE1 of rat, TC# 2.A.36.1.1). Both Pro167 and Pro168 in TMS IV are required for normal NHE activity (Slepkov et al. 2004). NHE1 regulates internal pH in human monocytes and is important in heart disease and cancer (Tsai et al. 2015). Structural studies have been performed using NMR and EPR (Lee et al., 2011; Nygaard et al. 2011).  Extracytoplasmic loops contribute to ion coordination and inhibitor sensitivity (Lee et al. 2012).  The regulation of NHE1 has been reviewed (Wakabayashi et al. 2013).  CD44 (LHR, MDU2, MDU3, MIC4; P16070; TC# 9.B.87.1.31) regulates breast cancer metastasis by regulating NHE1 expression (Chang et al. 2014).  The role of NHE1 in kidney proximal tubule
functions, including pH regulation, vectorial Na+ transport, cell volume control and cell survival has been reviewed (Parker et al. 2015).  Helix M9 and  the adjacent exofacial re-entrant loop 5 between M9 and M10 (EL5) are important elements involved in cation transport and inhibitor sensitivity (Jinadasa et al. 2015).  A 12 TMS topology has been confirmed (Liu et al. 2015).  Mutations  cause Lichtenstein-Knorr syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition that associates sensorineural
hearing loss with cerebellar ataxia (Guissart et al. 2015). Cleaved FAS ligand (transmembrane CD95L; 1 TMS; P48023) activates NHE1 through the Akt/ROCK1 signalling pathway to stimulate cell motility (Monet et al. 2016). NHE1 may contribute to internal pH and motility of mammalian sperm (Muzzachi et al. 2018). NHE1 appears to be the only significant regulator of intracellular pH in preimplantation mouse embryos (Siyanov and Baltz 2013). The intracellular loop, IL5, is critical for proton sensing and ion transport (Wong et al. 2018). NHE1 and CD44 (the hyaluronan receptor with 742 aas and 2 TMSs, one at the N-terminus and one at the C-terminus (P16070)) appear to play important roles in cardiac remodeling (Suleiman et al. 2018). A three-dimensional model of NHE1, accounting for inhibitor binding, has been proposed (Dutta and Fliegel 2019). It forms a complex with Kv11.1 (TC# 1.A.1.20.1) and β-integrin (TC# 9.B.87.1.25). Activation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 is regulated by the extracellular environment and protein cofactors, including calcineurin B homologous proteins 1 and 2 (Cottle et al. 2020). NHE1, a central regulator of transmembrane pH that supports carcinogenic progression, is inhibited by 5- and 6-substituted amilorides (Buckley et al. 2021). The roles of NHE1 in health and disease have been reviewed (Fliegel 2021). Citronellal suppresses the expression of NHE1 and TPRM2, alleviates 
oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage, and imposes a protective 
effect on endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats (Yin et al. 2022). Osmotic stress increases the intracellular pH through SLC9A1 (Zhang et al. 2022). Oxaliplatin (OHP)-induced intracellular acidification of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons largely depends 
on calcineurin (CaN)-mediated NHE1 inhibition, revealing new mechanisms that OHP can
 exert to alter neuronal excitability (Dionisi et al. 2023). Slc9a1 plays a vital role in chitosan oligosaccharide transport across the intestinal mucosa of mice (Wen et al. 2023)."	Animals
2.A.36.1.14	"Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 6 (Na+/H+ exchanger 6) (NHE-6) (Solute carrier family 9 member 6; SLC9A6).  This Na+/H+ exchanger is encoded by an X-linked gene that is widely 
expressed and especially abundant in brain, heart and skeletal muscle 
where it is implicated in endosomal pH homeostasis and trafficking as well as maintenance of cell polarity. Several mutations in the coding 
region of NHE6 are linked with severe intellectual disability, 
autistic behavior, ataxia and other abnormalities (Ilie et al. 2014).  A Christianson syndrome-linked mutation disrupts endosomal function and elicits neurodegeneration and cell death (Ilie et al. 2016; Hussain et al. 2023.  Heterozygous female mice suffer from visuospatial memory and motor
coordination deficits similar to but less severe than those observed in X-chromosome hemizygous

2.A.36.1.19	"Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 9 (Na+/H+ exchanger 9) (NHE-9; NHE9) (Solute carrier family 9 member 9, SLC9A9) of 645 aas and 12 TMSs. It may act in electroneutral exchange of protons for Na+ across membranes and is involved in the effusion of Golgi luminal H+ in exchange for cytosolic cations. It is also involved in organellar ion 
homeostasis by contributing to the maintenance of the unique acidic pH 
values of the Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in the cell (Nakamura et al. 2005). The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NHE9 from Equus caballus at 3.2 A resolution has been determined (Winklemann et al. 2020). It is an endosomal isoform highly expressed in the brain and associated with autism spectrum (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) disorders in humans. The NHE9 architecture and ion-binding site are similar to distantly related bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters with 13 transmembrane segments. The conserved architecture of the NHE ion-binding site, their elevator-like structural transitions, the functional implications of autism disease mutations and the role of phosphoinositide lipids to promote homodimerization that, together, have important physiological ramifications have been revealed (Winklemann et al. 2020)."	Animals
2.A.36.1.2	Na+:H+ antiporter 3 (NHE-3 or NHE3). Regulated by Na+/H+ exchange regulatory cofactors (NHERF; O14745; TC #8.A.24.1.1) (Seidler et al., 2009). Cyclic AMP-mediated endocytosis of intestinal epithelial NHE3 requires binding to synaptotagmin 1 (Musch et al., 2010).  Decreased activity is responsible for congenital Na+ diarrhea in the human brush boarder (Janecke et al. 2015). Reduced functional expression of NHE3, and DRA contribute to Cl- and Na+ stool loss in microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) diarrhea (Kravtsov et al. 2016).	Animals
2.A.36.1.20	Endomembrane (Golgi) K+, Na+/H+ exchanger 5, NHX5, of 521 aas and 11 TMSs.  Three acidic residues are critical for transport activity as well as seedling growth, regulation of protein transport into vesicles and ionic homeostasis (Qiu 2016). NHX6 is 80% identical to NHX5 (535 aas and 11 TMSs) and serves the same function. They are all located in Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prevacuolar compartment (PVC). They are critical for salt tolerance stress and the homeostasis of pH and K+ (Wang 2019).	Plants

2.A.36.1.3	Na+/K+:H+ antiporter, Nhe-7, present in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. There are four isoforms, NHE6-9. They regulate the luminal pH as well as intracellular trafficking, and function in cell polarity development (Ohgaki et al., 2011). Nhe-6 (Nhe6) is associated with X-linked intellectural disability and autism when processing and trafficking is impaired (Ilie et al. 2013).	Animals

2.A.36.2.2	The electroneutral Na+/Li+:H+ antiporter, Nha2. Catalyzes Na+:Li+ antiport; contributes to salt homeostasis. It correlates with heritable hypertension (Xiang et al., 2007) and is critical for insulin secretion (Deisl et al. 2013). Like electrogenic Na+/H+ exchangers, it has two conserved aspartyl residues in the Na+ binding site but seems to be electroneutral (Uzdavinys et al. 2017). The structure, mechanism and lipid-mediated remodeling of the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger NHA2, linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, have been described (Matsuoka et al. 2022). NHA2 consists of 14 TMSs, rather than the 13 previously observed in mammalian NHEs and related bacterial antiporters. The additional N-terminal helix in NHA2 forms a unique homodimer interface with a large intracellular gap between the protomers, which closes in the presence of phosphoinositol lipids. Possibly the additional N-terminal helix has evolved as a lipid-mediated remodeling switch for the regulation of NHA2 activity (Matsuoka et al. 2022).	Animals

2.A.36.4.2	Na+:H+ antiporter, Nha2 or Sod2-22.  Exports Na+ and Li+ but not K+.  Three residues, T141 in TMS 4, A179 in TMS 5 and V375 in TMS 11, determine the cation selectivity (Kinclova-Zimmermannova et al. 2015).	Yeast
2.A.36.4.3	"Na+:H+ antiporter, Nha1 or Sod2 of 468 aas and 12 or 13 TMSs.  It provides salt tolerance by removing sodium and lithium ions in exchange for protons, and TMS 4 plays an important role (Ullah et al. 2013). The Asp266/Asp267 pair are critical for Sod2 function (Fliegel 2005).
 Residues within TMS 11 also play important roles in transport, 
suggesting that this TMS forms part of the ion translocation core (Dutta et al. 2017). Conserved transmembrane charged residues and a yeast-specific extracellular loop are also important for function (Dutta et al. 2019)."	Yeast

2.A.36.5.7	Na+:H+ antiporter, NHX4 of 538 aas and 12 TMSs. The relationships of the expression of the six maize  NHX proteins with salt resistance of maize have been examined (Zörb et al. 2005). Upon high salt (NaCl) stress in Aelurtopus lagopoides, the amount of the probable ortholog (78% identcal) increases (Ahmed et al. 2013). This protein is of the same length and topology with 79% identity as the ortholog in Triticum aestivum which may facilitate differential abiotic stress tolerance (Sharma et al. 2020).

It is involved in vacuolar ion compartmentalization necessary for cell volume regulation and cytoplasmic Na+ detoxification (Yokoi et al. 2002).

A cation binding pocket in the middle of the membrane and a pathway leading to it have been identified (Mourin et al. 2018). There are 3 NhaP types in Vibrio cholerae (Vc-NhaP1, 2, and 3).  They are critical for maintenance of K+ homeostasis in the cytoplasm, and all 3 are required for cell survival at low pHs, suggesting a role in acid tolerance (Mourin et al. 2019). The solution structure of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ~200 aas has been solved (Orriss et al. 2020). It reveals a compact N-terminal domain which resembles a Regulator of Conductance of K+ channels (RCK) domain connected to a more open C-terminal domain via a flexible 20 amino acid linker. NMR titration experiments showed that the protein binds ATP through its N-terminal domain (Orriss et al. 2020). Modified amiloride analogs with promising binding properties have been developed. Four selected drugs interacted with functionally important amino acid residues located on the cytoplasmic side of TMS VI, the extended chain region of TMSs V and XII, and the loop region between TMSs VIIII and IX (Mourin et al. 2021).

2.A.36.7.10	Na+/H+ antiporter of 1145 aas and 12 TMSs, SOS1.  Suppresses salt (200 mM NaCl) sensitivity, promoting tolerance (Wu et al. 2007). It is 65% identical to the A. thaliana homologue (TC# 2.A.36.7.6). In Solanum tuberosum, there are 37 salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1) genes (Liang et al. 2023). Most of the gene products are located in the plasma membrane. Promoter analysis revealed that the majority of these StSOS1 genes contain abundant cis-elements involved in various abiotic stress responses. Tissue specific expression showed that 21 of the 37 StSOS1s are widely expressed in various tissues or organs of the potato. Molecular interaction network analysis suggests that 25 StSOS1s may interact with other proteins involved in potassium ion transmembrane transport and response to salt stress. RT-qPCR results revealed that the expression of StSOS1s are significant modulated by various abiotic stresses, in particular salt and abscisic acid stress (Liang et al. 2023).

Ion currents through the voltage sensor domains (VSDs) of distinct families of proteins have been studied (Arcos-Hernández and Nishigaki 2023).  The VSD confers voltage sensitivity to different types of transmembrane proteins such as (1) voltage-gated ion channels, (2) the voltage-sensing phosphatase (Ci-VSP), and (3) this sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE). VSDs contain four TMSs (S1-S4) and several positively charged amino acids in S4, which are essential for the voltage sensitivity of the protein. Generally, in response to changes in the Vm, the positive residues of S4 displace along the plasma membrane without generating ionic currents through this domain. However, some native (e.g., Hv1 channels) and mutants of VSDs produce ionic currents. These gating pore currents are usually observed in VSDs that lack one or more of the conserved positively charged amino acids in S4. The gating pore currents can also be induced by the isolation of a VSD from the rest of the protein domains. Arcos-Hernández and Nishigaki 2023 summarized gating pore currents from all families of proteins with VSDs with classification into three cases: (1) pathological, (2) physiological, and (3) artificial currents.  SLC9C1, underlies hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide stimulated proton fluxes across sperm membranes and regulates their hyperactivated motility. It is the first known instance of an ion transporter that uses a canonical voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and an evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) to influence the dynamics of its ion-exchange domain (ED) (Chowdhury and Pal 2023).  Binding of cAMP causes large conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains and disrupts key ARD-linked interfaces. These structural changes rescue the transmembrane domains from an auto-inhibited state and facilitate their functional dynamics (Chowdhury and Pal 2023).	Animals
2.A.36.7.6	"Dimeric Salt-Overly-Sensitive 1 (SOS1) sodium:proton exchanger 7 (NHX7) (Núñez-Ramírez et al. 2012).  The salt stress-induced SOS pathway in A. thaliana involves the perception of a calcium signal by the SOS3 and SOS3-like 
CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8; TC# 5.B.1.1.8) calcium sensors, which then interact 
with and activate the SOS2 protein kinase (9.B.106.3.4), forming a complex at the 
plasma membrane that activates the SOS1 Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (Lin et al. 2014).  The involvement of SOS1 in Na+ efflux in plant roots has been reviewed (Britto and Kronzucker 2015). SOS1 appears to encode a salinity-inducible plasma membrane Na+ /H+ antiporter (Song et al. 2012). ZmSWEET1b is responsible for assimilation and salt stress response in maize. It is generally important for maize plant development and responses to salt stress (Wu et al. 2023). SOS1) is an electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter at the plasma membrane of higher plants and plays a central role in resisting salt stress. SOS1 is kept in a resting state with basal activity and activated upon phosphorylation. Wang et al. 2023 reported structures of SOS1 which forms a homodimer, with each monomer composed of transmembrane and intracellular domains. SOS1 is locked in an occluded state by shifting of the lateral-gate TM5b toward the dimerization domain, thus shielding the Na+/H+ binding site. Ddimerization of the intracellular domain stabilizes the transporter in this conformation. Moreover, two discrete fragments and a residue W1013 are important to prevent the transition of SOS1 to an alternative conformational state. A study enhances an understanding of the alternate access model of eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers (Wang et al. 2023).  The structure and activation mechanism of the rice SOS1 Na+/H+ antiporter has been described (Zhang et al. 2023)."

Catalyzes xylose facilitated diffusion in lactobacilli. The order of D-sugar substrate affinities is:  glucose > mannose > 2-deoxyglucose > N-acetylglucosamine > glucosamine > N-acetylmannosamine > mannosamine > fructose (Rephaeli and Saier 1980).  The mechanism appears to be rapid equilibrium, random, bi-bi sequential (Rephaeli and Saier 1980). L-sugars are not transported. This system is allostericallly inhibited by a complex of DicB (62 aas, P09557) and MinC (231 aas, P18186) (Jeckelmann and Erni 2020). At the transcriptional level, the manXYZ operon is regulated by the Mlc transcriptional regulator, and at the translational level it is regulated by the DicF small RNA that is complementary to manXYZ (Jeckelmann and Erni 2020). The 3-d structure of the IIC/IID complex revealed that the N- and C-terminal halves form the transport and scaffold domains, respectively (Liu et al. 2019).  Two 3-helix bundles are mixed by an intersubunit helix swap yielding tight intersubunit contacts with a novel fold. An ""elevator"" mechanism has been proposed in which the transport domain moves vertically or rotates relative to a stationary scaffold domain, where both the transport and scaffold domains consist of α-helices of both the IIC aqnd IID domains.

2.A.7.1.3	"Small cationic multidrug efflux pump (substrates: cationic lipophilic drugs), EmrE. This pump confers resistance to a wide range of disinfectants and dyes known as quaternary cation compounds (QCCs). The 3-D structure of the dimeric EmrE shows opposite orientation of the two subunits in the membrane (Chen et al., 2007), and this conclusion has been confirmed (Fleishman et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2008; Lloris-Garcerá et al. 2013). There may be a single intermediate state in which the substrate is occluded and immobile (Basting et al., 2008).  Direct interaction between substrates (tetraphenylphosphonium, TPP+ and MTP+) and Glu14 in TMS1 has been demonstrated using solid state NMR (Ong et al. 2013).  A Gly90X6Gly97 motif is important for dimer formation (Elbaz et al., 2008).  Two models may account for the opposite (inverted) orientations of the two identical subunits. A post-translational model posits that topology remains malleable after synthesis and becomes fixed once the dimer forms. A second, co-translational model, posits that the protein inserts in both topologies in equal proportions (Woodall et al. 2015).  Protonation of E14 leads to rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient (Dastvan et al. 2016). TMS4 is the known dimerization domain of EmrE (Julius et al. 2017). Few conserved residues are essential for drug polyselectivity. Aromatic QCC selection involves a greater portion of conserved residues compared to other QCCs (Saleh et al. 2018).     The topologies of helical membrane proteins are generally defined during insertion of the transmembrane
helices, yet topology can change after insertion. In EmrE, topology flipping occurs so that the populations in both orientations equalize. Woodall et al. 2017 demonstrated that when EmrE is forced to insert in a distorted topology, topology
flipping of the first TMS can occur, and
topological malleability also extends to the C-terminal helix; even complete
inversion of the entire EmrE protein can occur after the full protein is translated and inserted.
Thus, topological rearrangements appear to be possible during biogenesis. Subtle but significant differences in the sizes of EmrE with different QCC ligands bound has been reported (Qazi and Turner 2018). The two Glu14 residues in the dimer have independent pKa values and are not electrostatically coupled (Li et al. 2021). High level cell-free expression and specific labeling of EmrE has been achieved (Klammt et al. 2004). Cotranslational folding and assembly of the dimeric E. coli EmrE has been documented (Mermans et al. 2022). Harmane binding can uncoupled proton flux through EmrE. In E. coli, EmrE-mediated dissipation of the transmembrane pH gradient provides the mechanism underlying the in vivo phenotype of harmane susceptibility (Spreacker et al. 2022)."	Bacteria

2.A.7.11.1	"Possible UDP-galactose:UMP and documented ATP/ADP exchanger (antiporter).  Residues essential or important for activity have been identified (Chan et al. 2010). The apparent affinities of SLC35B1 for ATP/ADP on the internal face were approximately 13 times higher than those on the external side (Schwarzbaum et al. 2022). ATP/ADP exchange by SLC35B1 is not strict; other di- and trinucleotides can act as counter-substrates for ATP, although mononucleotides and nucleotide sugars were not transported. Conserved residues K117 and K120 in TMS 4 and K277 in TMS 9 play critical roles in transport. The fact that SLC35B1 can promote ATP transport in exchange for ADP or UDP suggests a more direct coupling between ATP import requirements and the need for eliminating ADP and UDP, which are generated as side products of reactions taking place in the ER-lumen (Schwarzbaum et al. 2022).

2.A.7.20.1	"Chloroquine resistance transporter, PfCRT. Martin et al. (2009) have demonstrated Chloroquine transport via PfCRT. It co-transports chloroquine (CQ) or piperaquine (PPQ) and H+ out of the digestive vacuole (and hence away from its site of action) via a mutant form of the parasite's CRT (Lehane and Kirk, 2010).  Many mutations give rise to resistance (Tan et al. 2014; Buppan et al. 2018). The orthologue in P. vivax is 73% identical to the P. faciparum protein and has the same function (Sá et al. 2006). It is inhibited by verapamil, quinine, saquinavir and dibemethin 6a (Meier et al. 2018). TMS1 is involved in substrate selectivity and catalyzes chroroquine efflux (Antony et al. 2018). The vacuolar-half and membrane-spanning domains (especially TMS9) of PfCRT are more conserved, suggesting that its physiological substrate is expelled out of the parasite digestive vacuole. In the PfCRT occluded state, some evolutionary conserved sites, including positions related to drug resistance mutations, participate in a putative binding pocket located at the core of the PfCRT membrane-spanning domain (Coppée et al. 2020). pH-dependence of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter is linked to the transport cycle (Berger et al. 2023).  Several proteases are localized to the digestive vacuole and these 
proteases sequentially breakdown hemoglobin into small peptides, 
dipeptides, and amino acids. The peptides are exported into the host 
cytoplasm via the chloroquine-resistance transporter and an amino acid

2.A.7.25.4	The ichthyin (ICHN; Nipal4; Nipa4; SLC57A6) autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) disease Mg2+ transport protein (466 aas; 9 TMSs).  It transports Mg2+ as well as other divalent cations such as Ba2+, Mn2+, Sr2+ and Co2+, but to a much less extent than Mg2+. It may be a receptor for ligands (trioxilins A3 and B3) from the hepoxilin pathway (Lefèvre et al. 2004). Disease-causing mutations near the transport channel cavity lead to changes in channel architecture and ARCI function (Laadhar et al. 2019).	Animals

2.A.7.27.1	Csg2 (Cls2) Ca2+ homeostasis protein.  Cells lacking Csg2p accumulate Ca2+ in a pool which is exchangeable with extracellular Ca2+ . The mutant cells are Ca2+ sensitive. The protein has 410 amino acyl residues, with 9-10 TMSs. It exhibits an EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticular membrane. It is possible that it functions in Ca2+ sequestration. It regulates the activities of CSH1 and SUR1 during mannosyl phosphorylinositol ceramid synthesis. It forms heterodimers with CSH1 and SUR1 (Beeler et al. 1994; Takita et al. 1995). Cls2p likely functions in releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, somehow cooperating with calcineurin (Tanida et al. 1996).  It regulates the transport and protein leves of the inositol phosphorlyceramide mannosyltransferases Csg1 and Csh1 (Uemura et al. 2007).	Yeast

2.A.7.4.5	"UMAMIT14 amino acid efflux transporter of 374 aas and 10 TMSs, a member of the nodulin MtN21 family. It is involved in phloem unloading in Arabidopsis roots (Besnard et al. 2016). UMAMIT14 is expressed in root pericycle and phloem cells and 
mediates export of a broad range of amino acids. 
Loss-of-function of UMAMIT14 leads to a reduced shoot-to-root and 
root-to-medium transfer of amino acids originating from the leaves. 
These fluxes were further reduced in an umamti14 umamit18 double 
loss-of-function mutant. Thus, UMAMIT14 is involved 
in phloem unloading of amino acids in roots, and both UMAMIT14 and

The structures reveal that TPT adopts a 10-transmembrane drug/metabolite transporter fold. Both substrates are bound within the same central pocket, where conserved lysine, arginine and tyrosine residues recognize the shared phosphate group. A structural comparison with the outward-open conformation of the bacterial drug/metabolite transporter suggests a rocker-switch motion of helix bundles, and molecular dynamics simulations support a model in which this rocker-switch motion is tightly coupled to substrate binding to ensure strict 1:1 exchange. The results reveal the mechanism of sugar phosphate/phosphate exchange by TPT.

N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 
3-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic acid (KDN) (Hopkins et al. 2013). Peter et al. 2024 have proposed that conformational coupling of the sialic acid TRAP transporter HiSiaQM with its substrate binding protein HiSiaP accounts for its energetic features. The SBP can adopt an open- or closed state depending on the presence of substrate. The two transmembrane domains of TRAP transporters form a monomeric elevator whose function is strictly dependent on the presence of a sodium ion gradient (Peter et al. 2024).  cryo-EM structure of the Haemophilus influenzae N-acetylneuraminate TRAP transporter (HiSiaQM) at 2.99 Å resolution (extending to 2.2 Å at the core), revealed new features (Currie et al. 2024).

The protein complex is composed of 16 TMSs in SiaQ (4 TMSs) and SiaM (12 TMSs) that are structurally related to multimeric elevator-type transporters. The idiosyncratic Q-domain of TRAP transporters enables the formation of a monomeric elevator architecture.  A model of the tripartite PQM complex is experimentally validated and reveals the coupling of the substrate-binding P protein to the transporter domains. Peter et al. 2022 studied the formation of the tripartite complex and investigated the impact of interface mutants.

Photobacterium profundum at 2.97 Å resolution. SiaM comprises a 
""transport"" domain and a ""scaffold"" domain, with the transport domain 
consisting of helical hairpins as seen in the sodium ion-coupled 
elevator transporter VcINDY. The SiaQ protein forms intimate contacts 
with SiaM to extend the size of the scaffold domain, suggesting that 
TRAP transporters may operate as monomers, rather than the typically 
observed oligomers for elevator-type transporters. Davies et al. 2023 identified the Na+ and sialic acid binding sites in SiaM  from Photobacterium profundum at 2.97 Å resolution and demonstrated a strict 
dependence on the substrate-binding protein SiaP for uptake. They reported
the SiaP crystal structure that, together with docking studies, suggested

The complex includes 16 subunits with nine iron-sulfur clusters, reduced by electrons from NADH. Employing the latest crystal structure of T. thermophilus complex I, Gupta et al. 2020 used microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the chemo-mechanical coupling between redox changes of the iron-sulfur clusters and conformational transitions across complex I. The simulations revealed the molecular design principles linking redox reactions to quinone turnover and proton translocation in complex I. Using a zebrafish model of TB infection, Roca et al. 2022 found that 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces reverse electron transport (RET) in mitochondrial complex I.
 This in turn drives the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species (mROS), causing macrophage necrosis. The complex I inhibitor

clusters and 60 transmembrane helices. The structures of many of the supernumerary subunits were determined or modeled. The
structure provided insight into the roles of the supernumerary subunits in regulation, assembly and
homeostasis.  One such subunit, GRIM-19 or NDUFA13, (Q9P0J0 of the human homologue) is essential for membrane potential formation and NADH assembly (Lu and Cao 2008).  Stroud et al. 2016 showed that 25 of the 31 accessory subunits in the 45 subunit human NADH dehydrogenase complex are
required for assembly of a functional complex, and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability.
Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that loss of each subunit affects the
stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module (Stroud et al. 2016). Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in humans is associated with combinations of individually non-pathogenic missense mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants, affecting the MT-ND4, MT-ND4L and MT-ND6 subunit genes of Complex I (Caporali et al. 2018).

pore and affect apoptosis, cell adhesion and migration independently have been identified (Carrara et al. 2015). The TMBIM6 calcium leak channel activity negatively regulates autophagy and autophagosome formation, influencing cardovascular traits (Swain et al. 2020). It enhances autophagy through regulation of lysosomal calcium (Kim et al. 2020). A TMBIM6 deficiency enhances susceptibility to ER stress due to inhibition of the ER stress sensor IRE1alpha. Its overexpression improves glucose metabolism, and knockout mice develop obesity (Philippaert et al. 2020). TMBIM6 knockout mice feature high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. This coincides with profound changes in glucose-mediated Ca2+ regulation in isolated pancreatic beta cells and increases levels of IRE1alpha levels. TMBIM6-mediated metabolic alterations are mainly caused by its role as a Ca2+ release channel in the ER. Thus, TMBIM6(-/-) leads to obesity and hepatic steatosis by blocking Ca2+ transport (Philippaert et al. 2020). The mammalian Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif (TMBIM) protein family in humans consists of six evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic proteins that affect programmed cell death and the regulation of intracellular calcium levels (Zhang et al. 2021).

1.A.14.2.3	The 7 TMS proton-sensitive Ca2+ leak channel, YetJ.  The activity and high resolution 3-d structure have been determined (Chang et al. 2014). BsYetJ in lipid nanodiscs is structurally different from those crystallized in detergents. Li et al. 2020 showed that the BsYetJ conformation is pH-sensitive in the apo state (lacking calcium), whereas in a calcium-containing solution, it is stuck in an intermediate state, inert to pH changes. Only when the transmembrane calcium gradient is established can the calcium-release activity of holo-BsYetJ occur and be mediated by pH-dependent conformational changes, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Conformational substates involved in the process and a key residue, D171, relevant to the gating of calcium were identified. Thus, BsYetJ/TMBIM6 is a pH-dependent, voltage-gated calcium channel (Li et al. 2020). The transmembrane BAX inhibitor-1-containing motif 6 (TMBIM6) protein may modulate apoptosis by regulating calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Lan et al. 2023 investigated all negatively charged residues in BsYetJ, a bacterial homolog of TMBIM6. They reconstituted BsYetJ in membrane vesicles with a lipid composition similar to that of the ER. The charged residues E49 and R205 work together as a major gate, regulating calcium conductance in these ER-like lipid vesicles. However, these residues become largely inactive when reconstituted in other lipid environments. D195 acts as a minor filter compared to the E49-R205 dyad (Lan et al. 2023).	Firmicutes

It encodes a 7 TMS endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident viroporin (pUS21) capable of reducing the Ca2+ content of ER stores, which, in turn, protects cells against apoptosis. The US21 protein is a viral regulator of cell migration and adhesion through mechanisms involving its calcium channel activity (Luganini et al. 2023).	pUS21 of Human cytomegalovirus (strain Merlin) (HHV-5) (Human herpesvirus 5)

The expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is upregulated, whereas the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is downregulated in GRINA silenced cells (Xu et al. 2018).  Grina/TMBIM3 modulates NMDA receptors and voltage-gated CaV2.2 Ca2+ channels (TC# 1.A.1.11.9) in a G-protein-like manner (Mallmann et al. 2019).

2.A.15.1.10	"Glycine betaine transporter, BetP. BetP is a transporter with three different functions: betaine transport, osmosensing, and osmoregulation (Krämer and Morbach 2004).  The x-ray structure is known (3PO3; 2WIT; Ressl et al., 2009). Regulatory crosstalk in the trimeric BetP has been reported (Gärtner et al., 2011). An extracellular K+ -dependent interaction site modulates betaine-binding (Ge et al., 2011). The porter is trimeric and exhibits structural asymmetry (Tsai et al., 2011). The C-terminal domain is involved in osmosensing and is trimeric like wild-type BetP.  The two Na+  binding sites are between TMSs 1 and 8 in the first and second 5 TMS repeats, and between the equivalent TMSs 6 and 3 in the second and first repeats, respectively (Khafizov et al. 2012). interdependent binding of betaine and two sodium ions is observed during the coupling 
process. All three sites undergo progressive reshaping and dehydration 
during the alternating-access cycle, with the most optimal coordination 
of all substrates found in the closed state (Perez et al. 2014). BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidyl glycerol are present, and the mechanism has been discussed (Güler et al. 2016).  The K+-sensing
C-terminal domain results in K+-dependent cooperative betaine-binding (Ge et al. 2011). BetP is a homotrimer lacking exact 3-fold symmetry. The observed differences may be due to crystal packing, or they may reflect different functional states of the transporter, related to osmosensing and osmoregulation (Ziegler et al. 2004). Intracellular K+ alters the conformation of the disordered C- and N-terminal domains to allosterically reconfigure TMSs 3, 8 and 10 to enhance betaine interactions. A map of the betaine binding site, at near single amino acid resolution, revealed a critical extrahelical H-bond mediated by TMS3 with betaine (Tantirimudalige et al. 2022). Both the N- and C-terminal (45 aas) segments participate in autoregulation, transducing changes in K+ concentrations as well as lipid bilayer properties to the integral membrane part of the protein. The C-terminal segment has short helical elements and an orientation that confines interactions (Leone et al. 2022)."	Bacteria

1.A.30.1.1	"The flagellar motor  (pmf-dependent) (MotA-MotB). TMSs 3 and 4 of MotA and the single TMS of MotB comprise the proton channel, which is inactive until the complex assembles into a motor. Hosking et al. 2006 identify a periplasmic segment of the MotB protein that acts as a plug to prevent premature proton flow. The plug is in the periplasm just C-terminal to the MotB TMS flanked by Pro52 and Pro65. The Pro residues and Ile58, Tyr61, and Phe62 are essential for plug function (Hosking et al. 2006).
The mechanism of proton passage and coupling to flagellar rotation has been proposed (Nishihara and Kitao 2015).  About
a dozen MotA/B complexes are anchored to the peptidoglycan layer around the motor through the
C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of MotB (Castillo et al. 2013). Dynamic permeation by hydronium ions, sodium ions, and water molecules has been observed using steered molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy profiles for ion/water permeation were calculated (Kitao and Nishihara 2017). They also examined the possible ratchet motion of the cytoplasmic domain induced by the protonation/deprotonation cycle of the MotB proton binding site, Asp32. The motor (MotAB) consists of a dynamic population of mechanosensitive stators that are embedded in the inner membrane and activate in response to external load. This entails assembly around the rotor, anchoring to the peptidoglycan layer to counteract torque from the rotor and opening of a cation channel to facilitate an influx of cations, which is converted into mechanical rotation. Stator complexes are comprised of four copies of an integral membrane A subunit and two copies of a B subunit. Each B subunit includes a C-terminal OmpA-like peptidoglycan-binding (PGB) domain. This is thought to be linked to a single N-terminal transmembrane helix by a long unstructured peptide, which allows the PGB domain to bind to the peptidoglycan layer during stator anchoring. The high-resolution crystal structures of flagellar motor PGB domains from Salmonella enterica have been solved (Liew et al. 2017). Change in the C ring conformation for switching and rotation involve loose and tight intersubunit interactions (Sakai et al. 2019)."	Proteobacteria
1.A.30.1.2	The flagellar motor (smf-dependent) (PomAB; MotXY) (Okabe et al., 2005). PomB interacts with the third TMS of PomA in the Na+-driven polar flagellum (Yakushi et al. 2004). Sodium-powered stators of the flagellar motor can generate torque in the presence of the sodium channel blocker, phenamil, with mutations near the peptidoglycan-binding region of PomB (Ishida et al. 2019). FliL associates with the flagellar stator in the sodium-driven Vibrio motor (Lin et al. 2018). When the ion channel is closed, PomA and PomB interact strongly. When the ion channel opens, PomA interacts less tightly with PomB. The plug and loop between TMSs 1 and 2 regulate activation of the stator, which depends on the binding of sodium ion to the D24 residue of PomB (Nishikino et al. 2019). The PomA helices parallel to the inner membrane play roles in the hoop-like function in securing the stability of the stator complex and the ion conduction pathway (Nishikino et al. 2022). Na+-binding sites are formed by critical aspartic acid and threonine residues located in the TMSs of PomAB (Kojima et al. 2023). Vibrio alginolyticus forms a single flagellum at its cell pole. FlhF and FlhG are the main proteins responsible for the polar formation of the single flagellum. MS-ring formation in the flagellar basal body appears to be an initiation step for flagellar assembly. The MS-ring is formed by a single protein, FliF, which has two transmembrane (TM) segments and a large periplasmic region. FlhF is required for the polar localization of Vibrio FliF, and FlhF facilitated MS-ring formation when FliF was overexpressed in E. coli cells. These results suggest that FlhF interacts with FliF to facilitate MS-ring formation. Fukushima et al. 2023 detected this interaction using Vibrio FliF fragments fused to a tag of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) in E. coli. The N-terminal 108 residues of FliF, including the first TMS and the periplasmic region, could pull FlhF down. In the first step, Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and its receptor are involved in the transport of membrane proteins to target them, which delivers them to the translocon. FlhF may have a similar or enhanced function as SRP, which binds to a region rich in hydrophobic residues (Fukushima et al. 2023).	Bacteria

3.D.4.11.1	Cytochrome oxidase (Cox or CcO).  Reversible hydration-level changes of the cavity can be a key factor that regulates the branching of proton transfer events and therefore contributes to the vectorial efficiency of proton transport (Son et al. 2017). Cox16 is required for the assembly of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (respiratory chain complex IV (CIV)), possibly by promoting the insertion of copper into the active site of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2) (Cerqua et al. 2018; Aich et al. 2018). Lipid composition affects the efficiency of the functional reconstitution of the cytochrome c oxidase (Hugentobler et al. 2020). The DeepCys program has been used to predict the functions of cysteine residues in Cox2 (Nallapareddy et al. 2021).	Animals

A mutation in subunit A, D372I, a probable pump H+ binding site, uncouples H+ transport from electron flow (von Ballmoos et al. 2015). In this cytochrome ba3, O2 molecules that arrive at the reduction site diffuse through the X-ray-observed tunnel, supporting its role as the main O2 delivery pathway in this cytochrome ba3 as well as the cytokchrome aa3 of Rhodobacter spheroides (Mahinthichaichan et al. 2018). The proton loading site cluster in the ba3 cytochrome c oxidase that loads and traps protons has been identified (Cai et al. 2020).	Thermus/Deinococcus

transferred to NosZ by means of an electron transport chain (ETC) that 
conserves energy through proton motive force generation (Hein and Simon 2019). In both clade I and clade II NosZs, proton motive quinol oxidation by N2O is thought to be catalyzed by the Q cycle mechanism of a membrane-bound Rieske/cytochrome bc complex (Hein and Simon 2019). Nitrous-oxide reductase is part of a bacterial 
respiratory system which is activated under anaerobic conditions in the 
presence of nitrate or nitrous oxide. NosZ is similar in sequence to cytochrome c oxidase component 2 only in the C-terminal 100 aa residues of both proteins which contains a pair of cysteyl residues."	NosZ of Paracoccus denitrificans

3.D.4.3.2	"Cytochrome bd quinol oxidoreductase, CydA/CydB. Borisov et al. (2011) have presented evidence concerning a proton channel connecting the site of oxygen reduction to the bacteria cytoplasm and the molecular mechanism by which a membrane potential is generated. The CydX protein of 37 aas and 1 TMS, is encoded in the cydAB operon and functions as a subunit of the Cytochrome bd oxidase complex, activating its activity (VanOrsdel et al. 2013). The AppX protein of 30 aas and 1 TMS, is a paralogue of CydX and 
can substitute for it in activating the Cytochrome bd oxidase complex (VanOrsdel et al. 2013).  Cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidases are structurally unrelated to mitochondrial cytochrome c 
oxidases. Safarian et al. 2019 determined the structure of the E. coli cytochrome bd-I oxidase by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to a
 resolution of 2.7 angstroms. The structure contains a previously 
unknown accessory subunit CydH, the L-subfamily-specific Q-loop domain, a
 structural ubiquinone-8 cofactor, an active-site density interpreted as
 dioxygen, distinct water-filled proton channels, and an 
oxygen-conducting pathway. Comparison with another cytochrome bd oxidase
 revealed structural divergence in the family, including rearrangement of
 high-spin hemes and conformational adaption of a transmembrane helix to
 generate a distinct oxygen-binding site (Safarian et al. 2019). Subunit I of the cytochrome bd quinol oxidase from E. coli has nine transmembrane helices with the O2 reactive site near the periplasmic surface (Zhang et al. 2004). Two small proteins, YtkA (CtaK; 145 aas; P40768) and YczB (CtaM; 70 aas; O31467; TatAd) facilitate the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase in Bacillus subtilis (von Wachenfeldt et al. 2021). The latter protein may also function as a constituent of the Tat system (TC# 2.A.64.3.1)."	Bacteria
3.D.4.3.3	Cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase (COX; Cbb3; CcoNOP).  The 3-d structure is known to 3.2 Å resolution (PDB# 3MK7; 5DJQ) (Buschmann et al. 2010; Lee et al., 2012).  The structure explains a proton-pumping mechanism and the high activity of family-C heme-copper oxidases compared to that of families A and B (Buschmann et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012). A small subunit of 36 aas and 1 TMS, CcoM, was identified in the structure and plays a role in assembly and stability (Kohlstaedt et al. 2016; Carvalheda and Pisliakov 2017). CcoQ, another small protein of 62 aas (acc # F8H837) is an assembly factor for Cbb3-1 and Cbb3-2 (Kohlstaedt et al. 2017).  The A-, B- and C-type oxygen reductases each have an active-site tyrosine that forms a unique cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor. In the C-type oxygen reductases (also called cbb3 oxidases), this post-translationally generated co-factor occurs in a different TMS than for the A- and B-type reductases (Hemp et al. 2006).	Bacteria

It generates a proton motive force using protons and electrons from opposite sides of the membrane to generate H2O, transferring 1 proton/electron. The mechanism of generation of a transmembrane electric potential difference (Deltapsi) during the catalytic cycle of a bd-type triheme terminal quinol oxidase hasbeen reviewed (Borisov 2023).

Each bundle contains a pair of histidine residues and forms a heme-binding domain. The C-half domain binds a cofactor-heme molecule, while the N-half domain is vacant (Niwa et al. 2018).

3.D.4.5.1	"Quinol oxidase (CyoABCD). This cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase is a transmembrane protein of 663 aas and 14 or 15 TMSs, which oxidizes ubiquinone and reduces oxygen, while pumping protons (Marušič et al. 2020). The cytochrome bo3 complex is the component of the aerobic respiratory chain of E. coli that
 predominates when cells are grown under high aeration conditions. It has proton pumping
activity, pumping 2
 protons/electron. Protons are probably pumped via D- and K-channels 
found in the cyoB subunit (Abramson et al. 2000). Two independent structures of the proton-pumping, respiratory cytochrome bo 3 ubiquinol oxidase (cytbo3) have been determined by cryo-EM in styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer nanodiscs and in membrane scaffold protein (MSP) nanodiscs to 2.55- and 2.19-Å resolution, respectively (Li et al. 2021). The structures include the metal redox centers (heme b, heme o3 , and CuB), the redox-active cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor, and the internal water molecules in the proton-conducting D channel. Each structure also contains one equivalent of ubiquinone-8 (UQ8) in the substrate binding site as well as several phospholipid molecules. The isoprene side chain of UQ8 is clamped within a hydrophobic groove in subunit I by TMS0, which is only present in quinol oxidases and not in the closely related cytochrome c oxidases. Both structures show carbonyl O1 of the UQ8 headgroup hydrogen bonded to D75(I) and R71(I). In both structures, residue H98(I) occupies two conformations. In conformation 1, H98(I) forms a hydrogen bond with carbonyl O4 of the UQ8 headgroup, but in conformation 2, the imidazole side chain of H98(I) has flipped to form a hydrogen bond with E14(I) at the N-terminal end of TMS0. The authors proposed that H98(I) dynamics facilitate proton transfer from ubiquinol to the periplasmic aqueous phase during oxidation of the substrate. Computational studies show that TMS0 creates a channel, allowing access of water to the ubiquinol headgroup and to H98(I) (Li et al. 2021). Jose et al. 2021 investigated the key PM intermediate, 
which forms after O–O bond cleavage and precedes proton pumping, using 
magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. The authors observed features 
demonstrating that PM is a three-spin system, 
consistent with a consensus model including an iron(IV)-oxo species, 
a copper(II) ion, and a tyrosyl radical. These results provide validation of the O–O cleavage mechanism and open the door to 
understanding the proton pumping step (Jose et al. 2021)."	Bacteria
3.D.4.5.2	Cytochrome aa3 quinol oxidase subunits I- IV (E - H). The 3-D structure has been determined (PDB# 6KOE).

The structure shows that TM0 forms part of a cleft to accommodate the menaquinol-7 substrate. Crystals which had been soaked with the quinol-analog inhibitor HQNO (N-oxo-2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline) or 3-iodo-HQNO revealed a single binding site where the inhibitor forms hydrogen bonds to amino acid residues shown previously by spectroscopic methods to interact with the semiquinone state of menaquinone, a catalytic intermediate (Xu et al. 2020).

3.D.4.6.2	Cytochrome c aa3 oxidase (COX).

The D channel is the proton transporting channel, and mutations in residues along this channel, especially N139 in subunit 1, uncouple H+ transport from electron flow (Han et al. 2005). Liang et al. 2017 provided insight into the decoupling mechanisms of CcO mutants, and explained how kinetic gating in the D-channel is imperative to achieving high proton-pumping efficiency in the WT CcO.

"3.A.1 The ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) Superfamily 
The ABC superfamily contains both uptake and efflux transport systems, and the members of these two porter groups generally cluster loosely together with just a few exceptions (Saurin et al., 1999). ATP hydrolysis without protein phosphorylation energizes transport. There are dozens of families within the ABC superfamily, and family generally correlates with substrate specificity. However there are exceptions. The high resolution X-ray structures of several ABC transporters, both uptake and efflux systems, have been determined, and specific details of the transport mechanisms have been proposed (Davidson and Maloney, 2007; Lee et al., 2007). Several multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters catalyze lipid, lipopolysaccharide, and/or lipoprotein export. This can occur by a 'flip-flop' mechanism or a 'projection' mechanism (Nagao et al., 2010). Pagès et al. (2011) have described several classes of efflux pump inhibitors that counteract MDR. Known structures have been discussed by Zolnerciks et al. (2011) and by Wilkens 2015. Mechanistic models for the transport cycle have been compared (Szöllősi et al. 2017). Transporters can be modified posttranslationally by phsophorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation and/or palmitoylation (Czuba et al. 2018). Ford and Beis 2019 reviewed  progress on structural determination of eukaryotic and bacterial ABC transporters as well as novel proposed mechanisms.  There are 48 genes encoding ABC transporters in humans (Sakamoto et al. 2019).  1,4-dihydropyridines are inhibitors of the transmembrane efflux pump ABCB1 in cancer cells, and they potentiate the inhibitory effect of clofazimine in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Lentz et al. 2019). Phospholipids and cholesterol are inducers of cancer multidrug resistance and therapeutic targets (Kopecka et al. 2019). Multiple positions (residues) in the membrane domains of ABC transporters influence their substrate selectivities (Srikant et al. 2020). An involvement of ABC porters in cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) has been reviewed (Juan-Carlos et al. 2021). The functional dynamics (substrate transport) of ABC transporters are realized by concerted motions, such as NBD dimerization, mechanical transmission via coupling helices, and the translocation of substrates through TMDs, which are induced by the binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP molecules and substrates (Furuta 2021). Automatic algorithms have been derived that permit the large-scale identification of the solute binding protein (SBP) repertoire in proteomes (Ortega et al. 2022).  An alternating access mechanism for many bacterial and mammalian ABC-type multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters has been reviewed (Badiee et al. 2023). It has been proposed that ATP binding cassette transporters  
evolved roles in herbicide resistance through exaptation (Caygill and Dolan 2023).
Switch and constant contact models have been presented (George and Jones, 2012).  The prevailing paradigm for the ABC transport mechanism is the Switch 
Model, in which the nucleotide binding domains are proposed to dimerise 
upon binding of two ATP molecules, and thence dissociate upon sequential
 hydrolysis of the ATP. This idea appears consistent with crystal 
structures of both isolated subunits and whole transporters, as well as 
with the biochemical data. Nonetheless, an alternative
 Constant Contact Model has been proposed, in which the nucleotide 
binding domains do not fully dissociate, and ATP hydrolysis occurs 
alternately at each of the two active sites (Jones and George 2012).  In this model, one of the sites remains closed and contains an
occluded nucleotide at all times. The cassettes remain in contact, and the active
sites swing open in an alternately seesawing motion. Whilst the concept of NBD
association/dissociation in the Switch Model is naturally compatible with a single alternating-access channel, the asymmetric functioning proposed by the Constant Contact model suggests an
alternating or reciprocating function in the TMDs. A new model for the function of ABC
transporters has been proposed by Jones and George 2014 in which the sequence of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release in
each active site is directly coupled to the analogous sequence of substrate binding, translocation
and release in one of two functionally separate substrate translocation pathways. Each translocation
pathway functions 180 degrees out of phase.
As noted above, the porters of the ABC superfamily consist of two integral membrane domains/proteins and two cytoplasmic domains/proteins. The uptake systems (but not the efflux systems) usually possess extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors (one or more per system) which in Gram-negative bacteria are found in the periplasm, and in Gram-positive bacteria is present either as a lipoprotein, tethered to the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, or as a cell surface-associated protein, bound to the external membrane surface via electrostatic interactions. For those systems with two or more extracytoplasmic solute binding receptors, the receptors may interact in a cooperative fashion (Biemans-Oldehinkel and Poolman, 2003). These binding proteins fall into six phylogenetic clusters (Berntsson et al., 2010). Both the integral membrane channel constituent(s) and the cytoplasmic ATP-hydrolyzing constituent(s) may be present as homodimers or heterodimers. Two families of ABC transporters have members in which one or two receptors are fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the translocating membrane protein. This suggests that two or even four substrate-binding sites may function in the complex. Possibly multiple receptors in proximity to the translocator enhances the transport rate. Multiple receptors may also broaden the substrate specificity of the system (van der Heide and Poolman, 2002). These systems with covalent receptor domains linked to the transmembrane translocators are found in the PAAT family (TC #3.A.1.3) and the QAT family (TC #3.A.1.12) (van der Heide and Poolman, 2002). Some high affinity ABC uptake systems specific for vitamins, minerals and other small molecules, called ECF systems, lack an extracytoplasm receptor and function by a mechanisms as discussed by Slotboom 2014. Both ECF (type I) and binding protein receptor-dependent uptake systems have been found in eukaryotes, especially in chloroplasts of algae and lower plants (Choi and Ford 2021). The diversity of ABC transporter genes across the phylum Nematoda has been examined (Langeland et al. 2021). Most of the ABCB and ABCG subfamily members are actively involved in 
heavy metal responses, and the functions
 of specific ABC transporters in Cd2+ and Hg2+ stress responses is likely in soybean (Glycine max L.) (Naaz et al. 2023). Some ABCG transporters in plants are likely to transport plant terpenes (Salgado et al. 2023).
ABC transporters always have two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs or NBSs). ATP-bound NBDs dimerize in a head-to-tail arrangement,
with two nucleotides sandwiched at the dimer interface. Upon the binding of ATP molecules to nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters undergo a conformational transition from an inward-facing (IF) to an outward-facing (OF) state via chemo-mechanical coupling. The ATP binding energy is converted into distortion energy of several transmembrane helices (Arai et al. 2017). Both NBDs contribute residues to each of the
two nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) in the dimer. The
prototypical NBD MJ0796 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii forms ATP-bound dimers that dissociate
completely following hydrolysis of one of the two bound ATP molecules.  ATP hydrolysis at one nucleotide-binding site drives NBD
dissociation, but two binding sites are required to form the ATP-sandwich NBD dimer necessary for
hydrolysis (Zoghbi and Altenberg 2013). Single versus dimeric subunit ATPase have been discussed (Ford and Hellmich 2020). Transporters with two active NBSs are called canonical transporters, while ABC exporters from eukaryotic organisms frequently have a degenerate NBS1 containing noncanonical residues that strongly impair ATP hydrolysis. The latter have been reviewed (Stockner et al. 2020). A summary of the structures available and an overview of recent structure-based studies have been discussed, while the artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictions from AlphaFold-2 are considered (Huang and Ecker 2023). Eight families of MDR effux pump inhibitors, active against Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been described and reviewed (Compagne et al. 2023).  A total of 159 ABC genes were identified in the legume, Cajanus cajan, that belong to eight canonical classes, CcABCA to CcABCG and CcABCI (Mall et al. 2023). Different cis-acting regulatory elements like stress, hormone, and cellular responsive were identified, and expression profiling of CcABC genes at various developmental stages of different anatomical tissues was performed.
Kinases can affect the activities of ABC transporters as do protein-protein interactions. Crawford et al. 2018 reviewed the effects of such interactions on the ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC4, and ABCG2 of humans, showing how kinases and protein-protein interactions regulate these transporters. Yeast have all of these types of ABC transporters, and a comprehensive overview of these proteins of the drug-resistant human fungal pathogen, Candida glabrata (Kumari et al. 2018). A comprehensive review of the classes of efflux pump inhibitors from 
various sources, highlighting their structure-activity relationships, 
which can be useful for medicinal chemists in the pursuit of novel 
efflux pump inhibitors has appeared (Durães et al. 2018). Protein expression and functional relevance of various primary and secondary drug efflux and uptake porters at the Blood-Brain Barrier of human brain and glioblastoma have been investigated (Bao et al. 2019). ABC transporter gene expression and mutational status not surprisingly affect survival rates of cancer patients (Kadioglu et al. 2020). Copper N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (CuNG) exerted different modulatory activities towards 
ABC-transporter-expressing cells. While CuNG-mediated ABC-transporter 
inhibition may improve tumor chemotherapy, CuNG-mediated enhanced ABC-transport may be a new strategy to ameliorate inflammatory diseases 
associated with decreased ABC-transporter expression as in ulcerative 
colitis (Hartinger et al. 2023).
Acar et al. 2020 investigated the allosteric networks of three representative ABC transporters using a hybrid molecular simulations approach validated by experiments. Each of the three transporters uses a different allosteric network. In the constitutive B12 importer BtuCD, ATP binding is the main driver of allostery and docking/undocking of the substrate-binding protein (SBP), which is the driven event. The allosteric signal originates at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane before propagating to the extracellular side. In the substrate-controlled maltose transporter, the SBP is the main driver of allostery, ATP binding is the driven event, and the allosteric signal propagates from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In the lipid flippase PglK, a cyclic crosstalk between ATP and substrate binding underlies allostery. These results demonstrate that speciation of biological functions may arise from variations in allosteric connectivity (Acar et al. 2020).
Using mass spectrometry, Al-Majdoub et al. 2020 identified and quantified the amounts of 32 (out of 48) ABC transporters in several human tissues. ABCD3 was the most abundant in liver, whereas ABCA8, ABCB2/TAP1, and ABCE1 were detected in all tissues.They created an atlas which revealed that ABCB2/TAP1 may have TAP2-independent functions in the brain, and that livers from biliary atresia patients have quite different ABC-transporter profiles than controls. Nearly a third to half of patients with noninfectious uveitis (NIU) fail to achieve control with immunomodulatory therapy due to MDR (Tagirasa et al. 2020). Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a rare neurocristopathy.  ATPase transmembrane transporters, acetylglucosaminyltransferases, and phagocytic vesicle membrane proteins may contribute to the ROHHAD phenotype (Victor et al. 2023).  Mutations in ABC genes cause 21 monogenic diseases, and polymorphisms in
 these genes are associated with susceptibility to complex diseases (Duvivier et al. 2024). ABC
 transporters also play a major role in drug bioavailability, and they 
mediate multidrug resistance in cancer. At least 13 ABC transporters 
were shown to be involved in drug resistance in vitro.
The involvement of ABC transporters in transport of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants has been reviewed (Liu et al. 2021). 49 ABC transporter genes have been divided into eight subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH), including seven ABCAs, seven ABCBs, 10 ABCCs, two ABCDs, one ABCE, three ABCFs, 16 ABCGs, and three ABCHs according to phylogenetic analysis in Zeugodacus cucurbitae, a highly destructive insect pest of cucurbitaceous and other related crops (Xu et al. 2021). Transporter-mediated natural product-drug interactions have been reviewed for transporters in several different families (Bi et al. 2022). The new AlphaFold protein structure prediction tool predicts a new type of transmembrane domain fold within the ABC transporters that is associated with cation exporters of bacteria and plants (Younus et al. 2022).
Plant MRPs, or GS-X pumps (glutathione-conjugate or multispecific organic anion Mg2+-ATPases,  participate in the transport of exogenous and endogenous amphipathic anions and glutathionated compounds, usually from the cytosol into the vacuole. Encoded by a multigene family and possessing a unique domain organization, the types of processes that likely converge and depend on plant MRPs include herbicide detoxification, cell pigmentation, the alleviation of oxidative damage, and the storage of antimicrobial compounds. Additional functional capabilities might include channel regulation of activity and/or the transport of heavy metal chelates (Rea et al. 1998).
The TC system of classification uses the integral membrane proteins, not the energy coupling proteins, receptor, or auxiliary subunits to classify the system into families (Saier, 1994; 2000). The exception to this rule was the ABC superfamily which by engrained tradition was classified based on the use of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase for energy coupling before the TC system was designed. Since then it has become known that the membrane proteins of ABC export systems fall into three evolutionarily distinct families that followed three different pathways of origin (Wang et al., 2009). These have been designated ABC1, ABC2 and ABC3. ABC1 porters arose by triplication of a primordial 2 TMS element; ABC2 porters arose by duplication of a 3 TMS element, and ABC3 porters arose from a 4 TMS precursor that either remained as two 4 TMS proteins (a homo or hetero dimer) or internally duplicated to give 8 or 10 proteins, the extra two appear to be in the center between the two 4 TMS repeat units (Khwaja et al. 2005). The ABC functional superfamily therefore consists of at least three true superfamilies. The ABC subfamiies or clusters that belong to each of these three superfamilies are listed below. In addition, the LPS effluxing transport system family with TC# 3.A.152 may be unrelated to the other three exporter superfamilies (Thomas et al. 2020). Based on 3-D structures, there may also be three types of integral membrane ABC uptake systems, bringing the total to 7 types (Thomas et al. 2020).
Energy-coupling factor (ECF)-type ABC importers appear to fulfil important roles in both algae and plants where they form the ABCI sub-family. Choi and Ford 2021 discussed whether bacterial Type I and Type II ABC importers are present in extant eukaryotes. Type I importers exist in algae and the liverwort family of primitive non-vascular plants, but not in higher plants. The existence of eukaryotic Type II importers is also supported: a transmembrane protein homologous to vitamin B12 import system transmembrane protein (BtuC), hemin transport system transmembrane protein (HmuU) and high-affinity zinc uptake system membrane protein (ZnuB) is encoded within the Cyanophora paradoxa genome. This last protein has homologs within the genomes of red algae. Furthermore, its candidate nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) shows closest similarity to other bacterial Type II importer NBDs such as BtuD. Functional studies suggest that Type I importers have roles in maintaining sulphate levels in the chloroplast, while Type II importers probably act as importers of Mn2+ or Zn2+ , as inferred by comparisons with bacterial homologs. Possible explanations for the presence of these transporters in simple plants, but not in other eukaryotic organisms, are considered (Choi and Ford 2021). In order to utilise the existing nomenclature for eukaryotic ABC proteins, it was proposed that eukaryotic Type I and II importers be classified as ABCJ and ABCK transporters, respectively.

Uptake systems (TC#s 3.A.1.1 - 3.A.1.34) may be largely of the ABC2 type, but they have undergone extensive sequence and topological diversification. They even have different 3-dimensional structural differences, suggesting that they may have different origins. The only exception is ABC family 3.A.1.21, the Siderophore-Fe3+ Uptake Transporter (SIUT) Family which is clearly of the ABC1 type. It has no extracytoplasmic receptor as well. 
ABC importers have been divided into two classes: type I importers follow 
an alternating access mechanism driven by the presence of the substrate, while type II importers accept substrates in a
nucleotide-free state, with hydrolysis driving an inward-facing 
conformation.  RbsABC2 (TC#3.A.1.2.1) seems to share functional traits with both type I and type II importers, as
well as possessing unique features, and may employ a distinct mechanism relative to other ABC
transporters (Clifton et al. 2014).
Unlike most uptake systems which have one or two functionally equivalent membrane subunits that form a homo- or hetero-dimer and an extracytoplasmic receptor, a subset of these porters have two functionally dissimilar membrane subunits, called S (substrate recognition) and T (energy transducer) that are very divergent in sequence, and they lack extracytoplasmic receptors (Erkens et al. 2012). This group of ABC porters represent a subfamily within the ABC uptake systems. This subset, called Energy-coupling Factor 'ECF' porters, includes:

Karpowich and Wang (2013) characterized the ECF transporters from Thermotoga maritima and 
Streptococcus thermophilus and determined a subunit stoichiometry of
 2S:2T:1A:1A'.  They concluded that S subunits for different substrates can be 
incorporated into the same transporter complex simultaneously. In the crystal structure of the A-A' heterodimer, each subunit contains a
 novel motif called the Q-helix that plays a role in subunit 
coupling with the T subunits. A 
mechanism for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to transmembrane transport by ECF transporters was proposed. ECF porters mediate the uptake of micronutrients in prokaryotes, and consist of two ATP-binding-cassette family ATPases, a transmembrane coupling protein (T component) and a substrate-binding membrane protein (S component), as noted above. ECF transporters for Co2+ and Ni2+ ions have one or two additional proteins with extracytoplasmic regions. Homologs of T components with predicted localization in plastids are widespread in plants, but S components in eukaryotes are rare and restricted to biotin-specific variants (Finkenwirth and Eitinger 2019). Apart from a potential contribution to the export of flavins to serve the assembly of extracytoplasmic electron transfer chains, ECF transporters function as importers.
The maltose import transporter is composed of two TM subunits, MalF and MalG, and two subunits of a cytoplasmic ATPase, MalK. Like many uptake systems in Gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), is required to stimulate the ATPase activity of the transporter. In the absence of maltose, MBP exists in equilibrium between an open and closed conformation, and binding of maltose stabilizes the closed conformation. Two structures of MalFGK2 have been determined by x-ray crystallography. In the absence of MBP, MalFGK2 forms an inward-facing conformation with the TM maltose-binding site exposed to the cytoplasm. An outward-facing conformation, crystallized in complex with open MBP and ATP, shows that closure of the NBDs of MalK is concomitant with transfer of maltose from MBP to the TM subunits. These structures capture two states in the transport cycle: The inward-facing conformation represents the resting state where the transporter has a very low ATPase activity, and the outward-facing conformation represents a catalytic intermediate where ATP is poised for hydrolysis. Because MBP stimulates ATP hydrolysis and initiates the transport process, it must interact with the resting state conformation to form a 'pretranslocation' complex that is metastable in order to advance to the outward-facing conformation in the presence of ATP (25). Oldham and Chen (2011) presented the crystal structure of the initial complex formed between closed MBP and MalFGK2. As an essential intermediate between the inward- and outward-facing conformations, this structure suggests a mechanism by which substrate bound on the periplasmic surface influences the conformation of the NBDs at the intracellular surface. The same investigators suggested that ABC transporters catalyze ATP hydrolysis via a general base mechanism (Oldham and Chen, 2011).
The homodimeric LmrA drug efflux pump (TC #3.A.1.117.1) of Lactococcus lactis appears to function by an alternating site (half of sites) type mechanism. In many of these porters, the various domains are fused in a variety of combinations. Uptake porters generally have their constituents as distinct polypeptide chains, while efflux systems usually have them fused. ABC-type uptake systems have not been identified in eukaryotes, but ABC-type efflux systems abound in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The eukaryotic efflux systems often have the four domains (two cytoplasmic domains and two integral membrane domains) fused into either one or two polypeptide chains. The integral membrane porter domains each usually possesses 5 (uptake) or 6 (efflux) transmembrane spanners, but exceptions exist. For example, the MntB protein (TC #3.A.1.15.1) exhibits 9 established TMSs. The 3-dimensional structure of the E. coli MsbA protein (TC #3.A.1.106.1) has been solved to a resolution of 3.7 Å (Ward et al., 2007), that of the Staphylococcus aureus Sav1866 protein (TC #3.A.1.106.2) has been solved to a resolution of 3.0 Å (Dawson and Locher, 2006), that of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus ModABC complex has been solved at 3.1 Å resolution (Hollenstein et al., 2007), that of the E. coli BtuCDF Vitamin B12 transporter was solved at 2.6 Å resolution (Hvorup et al., 2007), and the maltose transporter has been solved at 2.8 Å resolution (Oldham et al., 2007). These structures are very different, but the two transmembrane domains form a single barrel 5-6 nm in diameter and about 5 nm deep with an entral pore open either to the external or internal surface spanning much of the membrane (Rosenberg et al., 2003). A model has been proposed allowing the channel to open up to the lipid bilayer. A half of sites model in which the two nucleotide binding domains interact in a fashion controlled by substrate binding has also been proposed (Hou et al., 2003; Loo et al., 2003).
Hollenstein et al. (2007) presented the 3.1 Å crystal structure of a putative molybdate transporter (ModB2C2) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus in complex with its binding protein (ModA). Twelve transmembrane helices of the ModB subunits provide an inward-facing conformation, with a closed gate near the external membrane boundary. The ATP-hydrolyzing ModC subunits reveal a nucleotide-free, open conformation, whereas the attached binding protein aligns the substrate-binding cleft with the entrance to the presumed translocation pathway. Structural comparison of ModB2C2A with Sav1866 suggests a common alternating access and release mechanism, with binding of ATP promoting an outward-facing conformation and dissociation of the hydrolysis products promoting an inward-facing conformation. ATP hydrolysis at one of the two sites in ABC transporters initiates transport-related conformational transitions (Gyimesi et al., 2011).
Smriti et al., 2009 mapped residues proximal to the daunorubicin
(DNR)-binding site in MsbA (TC#3.A.1.106.1) using site-specific, ATP-dependent quenching
of DNR intrinsic fluorescence by spin labels. In the nucleotide-free
MsbA intermediate, DNR-binding residues cluster at the cytoplasmic end
of helices 3 and 6 at a site accessible from the membrane/water
interface and extending into an aqueous chamber formed at the interface
between the two transmembrane domains. Binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP
analog inverts the transporter to an outward-facing conformation. DNR may thus enter near an elbow helix parallel to the
water/membrane interface, partitioning into the open chamber, and then
translocating toward the periplasm upon ATP binding.
The turnover rates of some transporters are inhibited by their substrates in a process termed trans-inhibition. Gerber et al. (2008) presented the crystal structure of a molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter (ModBC) from Methanosarcina acetivorans in a trans-inhibited state. The regulatory domains of the nucleotide-binding subunits proved to be in close contact, providing two oxyanion binding pockets at the shared interface. By specifically binding to these pockets, molybdate or tungstate prevent adenosine triphosphatase activity and lock the transporter in an inward-facing conformation, with the catalytic motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains separated. This allosteric effect prevents the transporter from switching between the inward-facing and the outward-facing states, thus interfering with the alternating access and release mechanism.
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; 3.A.1.202.1) is an
ATP-dependent chloride channel. Jordan et al., 2008 compared CFTR protein sequences to
those of ABCC4 proteins (the closest mammalian paralogs) to identify the evolutionary transition
from transporter to channel activity. R352 in the
sixth transmembrane helix interacts with D993 in TM9 to stabilize the open-channel state; D993 is
absolutely conserved between CFTRs and ABCC4s. Thus
CFTR channel activity evolved, at least in part, by converting the
conformational changes associated with binding and hydrolysis of ATP,
as are found in true ABC transporters, into an open permeation pathway
by means of intraprotein interactions that stabilize the open state.  In general, plant ABC transport systems are more numerous than those in animals.  The maize systems have been categorized and their expression profiles have been determined (Pang et al. 2013).
The LolCDE complex of Escherichia coli (TC# 3.A.1.125.1) initiates the lipoprotein sorting to the outer membrane by catalysing their release from the inner membrane. LolC and/or LolE, membrane subunits, recognize lipoproteins anchored to the outer surface of the inner membrane, while LolD hydrolyses ATP on its inner surface. The ligand-bound LolCDE has been purified from the inner membrane in the absence of ATP (Ito et al., 2006). Liganded LolCDE represents an intermediate of the release reaction and exhibits higher affinity for ATP than the unliganded form. ATP binding to LolD weakens the interaction between LolCDE and lipoproteins and causes their dissociation in a detergent solution, while lipoprotein release from membranes requires ATP hydrolysis. A single molecule of lipoprotein is found to bind per molecule of the LolCDE complex.
The three structurally dissimilar constituents of the ABC uptake porters have generally arisen from a common ancestral porter system with minimal shuffling of constituents between/domain constituents is almost always the same. However the rates of sequence divergences differ drastically with the extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors diverging most rapidly, the integral-membrane, channel-forming constituents diverging at an intermediate rate, and the cytoplasmic ATP-hydrolyzing constituents diverging most slowly. Thus, all ATP-hydrolyzing constituents are demonstrably homologous, but this is not true for the integral membrane constituents or the receptors. Nevertheless, clustering patterns are generally the same for all three types of proteins, and 3-dimensional structural data suggest that, in spite of their extensive sequence divergence, the extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors are homologous to each other.
Unlike most of the known ABC transporters, ABCC1 (TC #3.A.1.208.8) has an additional membrane-spanning domain (MSD) at its amino terminus with a domain arrangement of MSD0-MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2. The additional MSD0 domain consists of five putative transmembrane segments with a predicted extracellular amino terminus. It has a U-shaped folding with the bottom of the U-structure facing cytoplasm and both ends in extracellular space. This U-shaped amino terminus probably functions as a gate to regulate the drug transport activity of human ABCC1 (Chen et al., 2006).
Polar lipid trafficking is essential in eukaryotic cells as membranes of lipid assembly are often distinct from final destination membranes. A striking example is the biogenesis of the photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids) in plastids of plants. Lipid biosynthetic enzymes at the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner and outer plastid envelope membranes are involved. This compartmentalization requires extensive lipid trafficking. Mutants of Arabidopsis disrupt the incorporation of endoplasmic reticulum-derived lipid precursors into thylakoid lipids. Two proteins affected in two of these mutants, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1 (TGD1) and TGD2, encode the permease and substrate binding component, respectively, of a proposed lipid translocator at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. A third protein, TGD3, a small ABC-type ATPase, energizer transport. As in the tgd1 and tgd2 mutants, triacylglycerols and trigalactolipids accumulate in a tgd3 mutant. The TGD3 protein shows basal ATPase activity and is localized inside the chloroplast beyond the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Proteins orthologous to TGD1, -2, and -3 are predicted to be present in Gram-negative bacteria, and the respective genes are organized in operons suggesting a common biochemical role for the gene products. The Tgd1,2,3 system (TC#3.A.1.27.2) probably transfers ER-derived lipids to the thylakoid membrane (Lu et al., 2007). It is one of the few known eukaryotic uptake systems.
Rodionov et al., 2009 identified 21 families of these substrate capture proteins, each with a different specificity predicted by genome context analyses. Roughly half of the substrate capture proteins (335 cases) examined by Rodionov et al., 2009 have a dedicated energizing module, but in 459 cases distributed among almost 100 gram-positive bacteria, different and unrelated substrate capture proteins share the same energy-coupling module. The shared use of energy-coupling modules was experimentally confirmed for folate, thiamine, and riboflavin transporters. Rodionov et al., 2009 proposed the name energy-coupling factor transporters for the new class of putative ABC membrane transporters. These membrane proteins are homologues to ABC-2 exporters. When evidence is minimal for association with an ABC-type ATP-hydrolyzing subunit, these porters are placed in category 2.A (secondary carriers; e.g., 2.A.88).
Canonical ABC importers play important roles in cell integrity, environmental stresses, cell-to-cell communication, cell differentiation and pathogenicity. An ABC sub-superfamily of micronutrient importers, the 'energy-coupling factor' (ECF) transporters, use ABC ATPases. Fundamental differences between tranditional ABC and ECF porters include the modular architecture and the independence of ECF systems of extracytoplasmic solute-binding proteins. Eitinger et al. (2011) review the roles of both types of transporters in diverse physiological processes including pathogenesis. They also point out the differences and similarities in modular assembly and their traits.
The uptake porters of the ABC superfamily and of the vitamin/small molecule transporters described by Rodionov et al., 2009 are homologous to the porters in the VUT family (2.A.88). In fact, studies indicated that all uptake porters of the ABC superfamily are of the ABC2 type (Zheng et al. 2013). When evidence suggests that homologous membrane transport proteins of the ABC2 type couple transport to ATP hydrolysis using a homologue of the ABC-type ATPases, we list these proteins in the ABC superfamily. If there is no such evidence, (e.g., experimental evidence and the occurrence of the gene for the membrane transporter protein is in an operon that lacks the ATPase and auxillary subunit) then the porter is placed into family 2.A.88.
Ter Beek et al. (2011) have determined the subunit stoichiometry and functional unit of the energy coupling factor (ECF)-type of ABC 
transporters (Rodionov et al., 2009). ECF transporters consist of a conserved energizing module (two 
peripheral ATPases and the integral membrane protein EcfT) and an integral membrane protein responsible for substrate 
specificity (S-component). S-components for different substrates  
may associate with the same 
energizing module. The energizing module from Lactococcus lactis has been shown to form stable complexes with each of the eight predicted 
S-components found in this organism. Using light scattering, EcfT, the two 
ATPases (EcfA and EcfA'), and the S-component were found to be present 
in a stoichiometric 1:1:1:1 ratio. The complexes were reconstituted in proteoliposomes 
and shown to mediate ATP-dependent transport. ECF-type transporters are 
the smallest known ABC transporters.
Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a subgroup of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the uptake of vitamins and micronutrients in prokaryotes. In contrast to classical ABC importers, ECF transporters do not make use of water-soluble substrate binding proteins or domains but instead employ integral membrane proteins for substrate binding (S-components or EcfS). S-components form active translocation complexes with the ECF module, an assembly of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs, or EcfA) and a second transmembrane 'energy transducer' protein, EcfT. In many cases, the ECF module can interact with several different S-components that bind diverse substrates. The modular organization with exchangeable S-components on a single ECF module allows the transport of chemically different substrates via a common route. The determination of the crystal structures of the S-components that recognize thiamin and riboflavin provided clues about the mechanism of S-component exchange. Erkens et al. (2012) described current views of the transport mechanism by ECF transporters.
Some ABC exporters act on protein substrates. Export depends on the ABC transporter, a periplasmic 'adapter', the membrane fusion proteins (MFPs; 8.A.1) and an outer membrane factor (OMF; 1.B.17). Assembly of the tripartite complex can be transient and induced upon binding of the substrate to the ABC protein. Masi & Wandersman (2010) showed that in addition to the C-terminal targeting sequence, many additional signals throughout the substrate protein facilitate secretion. Interaction of the C-terminal 'targeting' signal activates the ATPase activity, causing disassembly of the complex. Thus, the proposed 'targeting' motif may signal dissociation rather than targeting (Masi & Wandersman et al., 2010). Dassa and Bouige (2001) have devised a phylogenetic/functional classification system for ABC transporters that overlaps the TC system. In their system, several of the TC families are included in single families. These reveal the closer phylogenetic relationship of TC families as follows:
Jones & George (2012) reported molecular dynamics simulations of the ATP/apo and ATP/ADP states of the bacterial ABC exporter Sav1866 (TC#3.A.1.106.2). Conformers of the active site have a canonical geometry for an in-line nucleophilic attack on the ATP γ-phosphate. The conserved glutamate immediately downstream of the Walker B motif is the catalytic base, forming a dyad with the H-loop histidine, while the Q-loop glutamine has an organising role. Each D-loop provides a coordinating residue of the attacking water, and comparison with the simulation of the ATP/ADP state suggested that via their flexibility, the D-loops modulate formation of the hydrolysis-competent state. A global switch involving a coupling helix delineates the signal transmission route by which allosteric control of ATP hydrolysis in ABC transporters is mediated. 
Binding of ATP to the nucleotide binding
domains (NBDs) of ABC proteins drives the dimerization of NBDs, which, in turn, causes large
conformational changes within the transmembrane domains.  NBD dimerization proceeds with a
large gain of water entropy when ATP molecules bind to the NBDs. The energetic gain arising from
direct NBD-NBD interactions is canceled by the dehydration penalty and the configurational-entropy
loss. ATP hydrolysis induces a loss of the shape complementarity between the NBDs, which leads to
the dissociation of the dimer, due to a decrease in the water-entropy gain and an increase in the
configurational-entropy loss (Hayashi et al. 2014).
ABC proteins play critical roles in maintaining lipid and sterol homeostasis in higher eukaryotes. In human, several subfamily-A and -G members function as cholesterol transporters across the cellular membranes. Deficiencies of these ABC proteins can cause dyslipidemia that is associated with health conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and neurodegeneration (Xavier et al. 2018). The physiological roles of ABC cholesterol transporters have been implicated in mediating cholesterol efflux for reverse cholesterol transport and in maintaining membrane integrity for cell survival.  The membrane constituents of ABC transporters may play key roles in determining the transport substrates and the translocation mechanisms via the transmembrane domains. High resolution structures of human sterol transporter ABCG5/G8 and its functional homologs have shed light on the structural features of ABC transporters. Xavier et al. 2018 outlined what is known about ABCG cholesterol transporters, addressed key structural features in the putative sterol translocation pathway on the transmembrane domains, and concluded by proposing a mechanistic model of ABC cholesterol transporters.
ABC peptide/protein exporters are usuallly believed to export their substrates directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium without a periplasmic intermediate.  However, a subgroup of systems, linked with a bacterial transglutaminase-like
 cysteine proteinase (BTLCP) apparently uses a two-step secretion mechanism.
 BTLCP-linked T1SSs transport a class of repeats-in-toxin (RTX) adhesins that are critical for 
biofilm formation. The prototype of this RTX adhesin group, LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, uses a novel N-terminal retention module to anchor the adhesin at the cell surface 
as a secretion intermediate threaded through the outer 
membrane-localized TolC-like protein LapE. This secretion intermediate is posttranslationally cleaved by the BTLCP family LapG protein to release LapA from its cognate T1SS pore. Thus, the secretion of LapA
 and related RTX adhesins into the extracellular environment appears to 
be a T1SS-mediated two-step process that involves a periplasmic 
intermediate (Smith et al. 2018).
The ABC-F family comprises an extremely diverse set of cytoplasmic ATPase proteins. All of the proteins in the ABC-F family characterized act on the ribosome and are translation factors (Ousalem et al. 2019). Their common function is ATP-dependent modulation of the stereochemistry of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in the ribosome coupled to changes in its global conformation and P-site tRNA binding geometry. Ousalem et al. 2019 presented an overview of the function, structure, and theories for the mechanisms-of-action of microbial ABC-F proteins including those involved in mediating resistance to ribosome-binding antibiotics.
Xiao et al. 2022 identified 87 ABC transporter genes in the genomes of Tenebrio molitor as well as those from Asbolus verrucosus (104), Hycleus cichorii (65), and Hycleus phaleratus (80). Combining these genes (336 in total) with published genes reported for Tribolium castaneum, the phylogeny of ABC transporter genes in all five Tenebrionids were analyzed. They were assigned to eight subfamilies (ABCA-H). In comparison to other species, the ABCC subfamily in this group of beetles appears expanded. The expression profiles of the T. molitor genes at different life stages and in various tissues were also investigated using transcriptomic analysis. Most of them display developmental specific expression patterns, suggesting their possible roles in development. Most of them are highly expressed in detoxification-related tissues including the gut and Malpighian tubule, from which roles in insecticide resistance were suggested. We detected specific or abundant expression of many ABC transporter genes in various tissues such as salivary gland, ovary, testis, and antenna (Xiao et al. 2022).
Dassa and Bouige (2001) summarized the protein and domain organization of each of the various family-type proteins (see Table 1). Based on the structures, a general mechanism for ABC transporters has been proposed, known as the Switch or Alternating Access Model, which holds that the NBDs are widely separated, with the TMDs and NBDs together forming an intracellular-facing inverted 'V' shape. Binding of two ATPs and the substrate to the inward-facing conformation induces a transition to an outward conformation. Despite this apparent progress, certainty around the transport mechanism for any given ABC remains elusive (Jones and George 2023). How substrate binding and transport is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis is not known, and there is a large body of biochemical and biophysical data that is at odds with widely separated NBDs being a functional/physiological state. An alternative Constant Contact model has been proposed in which the two NBSs operate 180 degrees out of phase with respect to ATP hydrolysis, with the NBDs remaining in close proximity throughout the transport cycle and operating in an asymmetric allosteric manner (Jones and George 2023).

3.A.1.1.1	"Maltooligosaccharide porter. The 3-D structure has been reported by Oldham et al. (2007). An altering access mechanism has been suggested for the maltose transporter resulting from rigid-body rotations (Khare et al., 2009). The maltose-binding protein is open in the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis during maltose transport (Austermuhle et al. 2004). Bordignon et al. (2010) and Schneider et al. (2012) reviewed the extensive knowledge available on MalEFGK2, its mode of action and its regulatory interactions.  The transporter sequesters the MalT transcriptional activator at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in the absence of the transport substrate (Richet et al. 2012).  The crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK2 bound with
 large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states have also been determined. In 
the pretranslocation structure, Oldham et al. 2013 found that the transmembrane subunit 
MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing
 end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmrembrane subunit MalF
 binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end. These
 structural features explain why large modified malto-oligosaccharides are not
 transported by MalFGK2 despite their high binding affinity to MBP. In the transport cycle, substrate is channeled from MBP 
into the transmembrane pathway with a polarity such that both MBP and 
MalFGK2 contribute to the overall substrate selectivity of the system (Oldham et al. 2013).  Stabilization of the semi-open
MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP
hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the
semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP (Alvarez et al. 2015). Both the binding of MalE to the periplasmic side of the transmembrane complex and binding of ATP to MalK2 are necessary to facilitate the conformational change from the inward-facing state to the occluded state, in which MalK2 is completely dimerized (Hsu et al. 2017). An integrated transport mechanism of the maltose ABC importer has been proposed (Mächtel et al. 2019)."	Proteobacteria
3.A.1.1.10	"Alginate (MW 27,000 Da) (and Alginate oligosaccharides) uptake porter. ABC transport system, AlgQ1AlgM1AlgM2(AlgS)2: AlgS, 363 aas, BAB03314; AlgQ1, 502 aas, 3VLW_A;  AlgM1, 324 aas, BAB03315.1; AlgM2, 293 aas, BAB03316.1. Sphingomonas species A1 is a 'pit-forming' bacterium that directly incorporates alginate into its cytoplasm through a pit-dependent transport system, termed a 'superchannel' (Murata et al., 2008). The pit is a novel organ acquired through the fluidity and reconstitution of cell surface molecules, and through cooperation with the transport machinery in the cells.  It confers upon bacterial cells a more efficient way to secure and assimilate macromolecules (Murata et al., 2008).  The substrate-transport characteristics and quaternary structure of AlgM1M2SS with AlgQ1 have been determined (Maruyama et al. 2015). The addition
of poly- or oligoalginate enhanced the ATPase activity of reconstituted AlgM1M2SS coupled with one
of the periplasmic solute-binding proteins, AlgQ1 or AlgQ2. External fluorescence-labeled
oligoalginates were specifically imported into AlgM1M2SS-containing proteoliposomes in the presence
of AlgQ2, ATP, and Mg2+. The crystal structure of AlgQ2-bound AlgM1M2SS adopts an inward-facing
conformation. The interaction between AlgQ2 and AlgM1M2SS induces the formation of an alginate-binding tunnel-like structure accessible to solvent. The translocation route inside the
transmembrane domains contains charged residues suitable for the import of acidic saccharides (Maruyama et al. 2015). 
This bacterium  is a Gram-negative rod, containing 
glycosphingolipids in the cell envelope, and is named Sphingomonas sp. 
strain A1 (Murata et al. 2022). The pit was dynamic, with repetitive opening and closing 
during growth on alginate, and directly included alginate concentrated 
around the pit, particularly by flagellins, alginate-binding proteins, 
localized on the cell surface. Alginate incorporated into the periplasm 
was subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by cooperative 
interactions of periplasmic solute-binding proteins and an ATP-binding 
cassette transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The mechanisms of 
assembly, functions, and interactions between the above-mentioned 
molecules were clarified using structural biology. The pit was 
transplanted into other strains of sphingomonads, and the pitted 
recombinant cells were effectively applied to the production of 
bioethanol, bioremediation for dioxin removal (Murata et al. 2022). The outer membranes of Sphingomonas strains contain GSL and is 
different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria, which contain LPSs 
in their cell envelope. Because of this property, the cell 
surface of Sphingomonas strains is more hydrophobic than that 
of other Gram-negative bacteria and shows high affinity toward 
hydrophobic chemicals such as dioxin and polypropylene glycol.
Strain A1 cells use polyuronates (alginate and pectin) and 
their depolymerization products as carbon sources for growth. 
Glucose and pyruvate can be utilized as carbon sources, but far 
less efficiently than polyuronates.
 Strain A1 cells grew well on alginate and oligoalginates with different
 M/G ratios at pH 6–7, 30 ℃ in aerobic conditions, with a doubling time 
of approximately 25 min. However, unlike almost all of the 
alginate-degrading bacteria analyzed to date, the cells of 
strain A1 contained most of their alginate lyases in the cytoplasm. This
 means that alginate in the medium has to enter the cells in order to 
make contact with alginate lyases (Murata et al. 2022).
The morphological characteristics of the cell surface were examined with
 cells of strain A1 grown in the presence or absence of alginate. The following morphological observations were made (Murata et al. 2022): (i) cells grown on 
alginate were of two types that always coexisted in the medium: cells 
with or without a pit,
 and this feature was not observed in the absence of alginate. (ii) The 
surface of cells grown in the absence of alginate showed a pleat-like 
structure without a pit. (iii) Cells grown in the presence of alginate produced pits on their cell surface, and
 The pits contained even globular particles, some of which were 
insoluble forms (granules) of alginate. (iv) When the alginate-grown 
cells were treated with ruthenium red, an agent used to stain 
mucopolysaccharides, the pit periphery was strongly and specifically 
stained,
 suggesting that alginate was concentrated in the pit. (v) The thin 
section of cells grown on alginate showed a specific region where the 
cell surface sunk into the cells but no such structures were observed in cells grown in the absence of 
alginate. (vi) The average pit size was 0.02–0.1 µm in diameter (Murata et al. 2022). Thus,  (a) the pit is formed only in the presence of alginate, (b) the pit 
functions as a concentrator of alginate, and (c) strain A1 cells have a 
pit-dependent alginate assimilation system, which differs from the 
alginate import and degradation pathway of other alginate-degrading 
microbes.
There are six protein constituents in the ABC transporter: AlgQ1, Q2,
 M1 M2 and S (AlgS is present with two copies where Q1 and 2 are 
periplasmic binding proteins, M1 and M2 comprise the integral membrane 
transport channel, and S is the dimeric ATPase. Alginate accumulated in 
the pit is delivered into the periplasm and then
 transported to the cytoplasm by this ABC transporter. Alginate is 
finally degraded into constituent monosaccharides by alginate lyases 
present in the cytoplasm. The gene cluster encoding these proteins are 
AlgO (regulatory protein)-AlgS-AlgM1-AlgM2-AlgQ1-AlgQ2. There are 8 cell
 surface proteins, p1 - p8.  P1 - p4 are TonB-dependent outer membrane 
transporters; p5 and p6 are flagellin-like proteins with alterred 
central domains of ~150 aas and high affinity for alginate (Kd = 10-9), and p7 and p8 are periplasmic alginate binding proteins (Murata et al. 2022)."	Proteobacteria

3.A.1.103.10	Wzm (M; 280 aas; 6 or 7 TMSs in a 2 + 3 + 1 or 2 TMS arrangement)-Wzt (C) ABC lipid-linked galactan precursor exporter. Deletion of the encoding genes results in severe morphological changes and the accumulation of an aberrantly long galactan precursor. A model for coupled synthesis and export of the galactanpolymer precursor in mycobacteria has been proposed (Savková et al. 2021). The two encoding genes are separated by a gene that encodes a galactofuranosyltransferase, GlfT1.	Wzm-Wzt of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Wzm, M, P72049 (Rv3783)Wzt, C, P72047 (Rv3781)
3.A.1.103.2	Heteropolysaccharide O-antigen exporter, Wzm/Wzt (Feng et al., 2004). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Wzt (an IgG-like β-sandwich) determines the specificity of the transporter for either O8 or O9a O-PS  (Cuthbertson et al., 2007). The transporter structure reveals a continuous transmembrane channel in a nucleotide-free state (Caffalette et al. 2019). Upon ATP binding, large structural changes within the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane regions push conserved hydrophobic residues at the substrate entry site towards the periplasm and provide a model for polysaccharide translocation. With ATP bound, the transporter forms a large transmembrane channel with openings toward the membrane and periplasm. The channel's periplasmic exit is sealed by detergent molecules that block solvent permeation. Molecular dynamics simulation data suggest that, in a biological membrane, lipid molecules occupy this periplasmic exit and prevent water flux in the transporter's resting state (Caffalette et al. 2019).

 aas and 6 TMSs (Wzm; also called AbcT3) and 396 aas and 0 TMSs (Wzt). The crystal 
structure is available (PDB 6AN7) (Bi et al. 2018) for the Wzm-Wzt homologue from Aquifex aeolicus in an open conformation. The transporter forms a transmembrane channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a linear polysaccharide. Its nucleotide-binding domain and a periplasmic extension form 'gate helices' at the cytosolic and periplasmic membrane interfaces that probably serve as substrate entry and exit points (Bi et al. 2018). O antigen structures are serotype specific and form extended cell surface barriers endowing many pathogens with survival benefits. In the ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, O antigens are assembled on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane on a lipid anchor and reoriented to the periplasmic leaflet by WzmWzt for ligation to the core lipopolysaccharides. This process depends on the chemical modification of the O antigen's nonreducing terminus, sensed by WzmWzt via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) that extends its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Caffalette and Zimmer 2021 provided the cryoEM structure of this full-length WzmWzt transporter bound to ATP in a lipid environment, revealing a highly asymmetric transporter organization. The CBDs dimerize and associate with only one NBD. Conserved loops at the CBD dimer interface straddle a conserved peripheral NBD helix. The CBD dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the NBDs and its putative ligand-binding sites face the transporter to likely modulate ATPase activity upon O antigen binding. A closed WzmWzt conformation in which an aromatic belt near the periplasmic channel exit seals the transporter in a resting, ATP-bound state. The sealed transmembrane channel is asymmetric, with one open and one closed cytosolic and periplasmic portal (Caffalette and Zimmer 2021)."	Wzm/Wzt of Aquifex aeolicus

3.A.1.104.1	Teichoic acid exporter, TagGH.  It is present in a large complex with the teichoic acid precursor synthetic enzymes (Formstone et al. 2008).  The substrate may be the diphospholipid-linked disaccharide portion of the teichoic acid precursor (Schirner et al. 2011).  3-d structural studies have been reported (Ko et al. 2016) showing that TagG and TagH are localized on the cytoplasmic membrane in a patch, and the TMS of TagH is important for normal transport activity (Yamada et al. 2018). The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of TagH reveals a potential drug targeting site (Yang et al. 2020). The ATPase activity of TagH-N was inhibited by clodronate, a bisphosphonate, in a non-competitive manner, consistent with the proposed wall teichoic acid-binding site for drug targeting (Yang et al. 2020).	Gram-positive bacteria
3.A.1.104.2	The teichoic acid precursor exporter, TarGH. May be specific for the diphospholipid linked disaccharide portion of the teichoic acid precursor (Schirner et al. 2011). TarG is the target of a small antimicrobial inhibitor of S. aureus growth (Swoboda et al. 2009). TarGH is a WTA transporter and has been purified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes (Matano et al. 2017). They showed that a new compound series inhibits TarH-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis even though the binding site maps to TarG, near the opposite side of the membrane. These are the first ABC transporter inhibitors to block ATPase activity by binding to the transmembrane domain.	Firmicutes

These two genes, presumable encoding an ABC exporter, are adjacent to lantibiotic biosynthesis genes. Therefore their function may be to export a lantibiotic.

3.A.1.105.5	"AbcG homologue, Snustorr, sioform A, Snu, of 808 aas and 6 TMSs in a 1 + 5 TMS arrangement at the C-terminal part of the protein.  The N-terminal domain is the ATPase domain.  The protein therefore has a C-M domain arrangement.  Lipids in extracellular matrices (ECM) contribute to barrier function 
and stability of epithelial tissues such as the pulmonary alveoli and 
the skin. In insects, skin waterproofness depends on the outermost layer
 of the extracellular cuticle envelope that contains cuticulin, 
an unidentified water-repellent complex molecule composed of proteins, 
lipids and catecholamines. Based on live-imaging analyses of fruit fly 
larvae, Zuber et al. 2018 found that initially, envelope units are assembled within 
putative vesicles harbouring the ABC transporter Snu and the 
extracellular protein Snsl. In a second step, the content of these 
vesicles is distributed to cuticular lipid-transporting nanotubes named 
pore canals and to the cuticle surface, dependent on Snu function. The surface of snu and snsl mutant larvae is depleted of
 lipids and cuticulin. Consequently, these animals suffer uncontrolled
 water loss and penetration of xenobiotics. The data allude to a 
two-step model of envelope (i.e. barrier) formation. The proposed 
mechanism in principle parallels the events occurring during 
differentiation of the lipid-based ECM by keratinocytes in the 
vertebrate skin, suggesting establishment of analogous mechanisms of skin
 barrier formation in vertebrates and invertebrates (Zuber et al. 2018)."	Animals

3.A.1.106.1	Phospholipid, LPS, lipid A and drug exporter, MsbA, which flips the substrate from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer leaflet (Eckford and Sharom, 2010). MsbA also confers drug resistance to azidopine, daunomycin, vinblastine, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium (Reuter et al., 2003). Four x-ray structures, trapped in different conformations, two with and two without nucleotide, have been solved (Ward et al., 2007). They suggest an alternating accessibility mode of transport with major conformational changes.  The mechanism and conformational transitions have been discussed (Moradi and Tajkhorshid 2013).  MsbA is energized both by ATP hydrolysis and the H+ electrochemical gradient (Singh et al. 2016). Mi et al. 2017 used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 Å-resolution structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA revealed that LPS binds deeply inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet. Two sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP revealed a closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. A  2.9 A resolution structure of MsbA in complex with G907, a selective small-molecule antagonist with bactericidal activity, revealed an unanticipated mechanism of ABC transporter inhibition. G907 traps MsbA in an inward-facing, lipopolysaccharide-bound conformation by wedging into an architecturally conserved transmembrane pocket. A second allosteric mechanism of antagonism occurs through structural and functional uncoupling of the nucleotide-binding domains (Ho et al. 2018). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including MsbA has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). Close-proximity effects and structural coupling of the transmembrane domains with the NBDs has been suggested (Josts et al. 2019). Two first-generation inhibitors of MsbA, TBT1 and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays, TBT1 and G247 were found to bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains (Thélot et al. 2021). MsbA adopts the wide inward-open conformation in E. coli cells (Galazzo et al. 2022).  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy rvealed that substantial chemical shift changes within both CH1 and CH2 occur upon substrate binding, in the ATP hydrolysis transition state, and upon inhibitor binding. CH2 is domain-swapped within the MsbA structure, and substrate binding induces a larger response in CH2 compared to CH1. These data show that CH1 and CH2 undergo structural changes as part of the TMD-NBD cross-talk (Novischi et al. 2024).	Gram-negative bacteria

across the cell membrane, an essential step during the N-linked 
protein glycosylation pathway. Transport across the membrane is effected
 via ATP-driven conformation changes. Most likely, only the polar and 
charged part of the glycolipid enter the substrate-binding cavity, and 
the lipid tail remains exposed to the membrane lipids during the 
transmembrane flipping process (Alaimo et al. 2006; Kelly et al. 2006; Perez et al. 2015). PglK may employ a ""substrate-hunting"" mechanism to locally increase the 
LLO concentration and facilitate its jump into the translocation 
pathway, for which sugars from the LLO head group are essential; the release of LLO to the outside occurs before 
ATP hydrolysis and is followed by the closing of the periplasmic cavity

3.A.1.106.18	"Peptide and multidrug resistance porter of the ABC superfamily, TmrAB. TmrA (Q72J05; 600 aas with 6 N-terminal TMSs) and TmrB (Q72J04; 578 aas with 6 N-terminal TMSs) comprise this heterodimeric transporter, both proteins of the M-C structure.  The system has been found to export the dye, hoechst 33342, and to be inhibited by verapamil (Zutz et al. 2011). The subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle 
electron cryomicroscopy has been solved (Kim et al. 2015). A cavity in the 
transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side 
of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the 
transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two 
nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal 
helices. Comparison between this structure and those of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of 
conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion 
between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from 
the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations (Kim et al. 2015). A subset of annular lipids is normally invariant in composition, with negatively charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, suggesting that this exporter may be involved in glycolipid translocation (Bechara et al. 2015). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including TmrAB has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). A 2.7-Å X-ray structure of TmrAB has been determined. It not only shares structural homology with the antigen 
translocation complex TAP, but is also able to restore antigen 
processing in human TAP-deficient cells. TmrAB exhibits a broad peptide specificity and can concentrate substrates 
several thousandfold, using only one single active ATP-binding site. It
 adopts an asymmetric inward-facing state, and the 
C-terminal helices, arranged in a zipper-like fashion, play a 
role in guiding the conformational changes associated with substrate 
transport (Nöll et al. 2017). Conformational coupling and trans-inhibition have been characterized (Barth et al. 2018), and a  conserved motif in intracellular loop 1 stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of TmrAB (Millan et al. 2021). A strong entropy-enthalpy compensation mechanism enables the closure of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) over a wide temperature range. This is mechanically coupled with an outward opening of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) accompanied by an entropy gain (Barth et al. 2020).  TmrAB undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+-ATP, and Mn2+ is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS (Rudolf et al. 2023). ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates the reverse transition.

However it's closest hit in TCDB (31% identity in the transmembrane domain) has TC# 3.A.1.106.18, which is probably a peptide/multidrug (and possibly glycolipid) exporter with broad substrate specificity.

3.A.1.106.2	The homodimeric Sav1866 multidrug exporter (transports doxorubicin, verapamil, ethidium, tetraphenylphosphonium, vinblastine and the fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33342; 3-D structure known at 3 Å resolution; Dawson and Locher, 2006; Velamakanni et al., 2008) The empty site opens by rotation of the nucleotide-binding domain whereas the ATP-bound site remains occluded (Jones and George, 2011). Conformational changes induced by ATP-binding and hydrolysis have been proposed (Becker et al. 2010; Oliveira et al., 2011). The alternating access mechanism and the flippase activity of this ABC exporter has been shown to be lipid-dependent (Immadisetty et al. 2019).	Gram-positive Bacteria
3.A.1.106.20	MsbA of 582 aas and 6 TMSs in an M-C arrangement.  The X-ray structure at 2.8 Å resolution in an inward-facing conformation after cocrystallization with lipid A and using a stabilizing facial amphiphile has been reported (Padayatti et al. 2019). The structure displays a large amplitude opening in the transmembrane portal, which is likely to be required for lipid A to pass from its site of synthesis into the protein-enclosed transport pathway. Putative lipid A density is observed further inside the transmembrane cavity, consistent with a trap and flip model. Additional electron density attributed to lipid A is observed near an outer surface cleft at the periplasmic ends of the transmembrane helices (Padayatti et al. 2019).

It activates the sensor kinase, KinA, during sporulation initiation (Fukushima et al. 2006). Large scale purification has been achieved (Galián et al. 2011).  It has been reconstituted in giant unilamellar vesicles (Dezi et al. 2013).  It exhibits an asymmetric
configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of
the TMS domains, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, may be driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis (Mishra et al. 2014). A novel intermediate of BmrCD, a heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporter from Bacillus subtilis. has been identified (Thaker et al. 2021). In the cryo-EM structure, ATP-bound BmrCD adopts an inward-facing architecture featuring two molecules of the substrate Hoechst-33342 in an asymmetric head-to-tail arrangement. Deletion of the extracellular domain capping the substrate-binding chamber or mutation of Hoechst-coordinating residues abrogates cooperative stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. These findings support a mechanistic role for symmetry mismatch between the nucleotide binding and the transmembrane domains in the conformational cycle of ABC transporters (Thaker et al. 2021). Lipid interactions with BmrCD modulate the energy landscape, suggesting a distinct transport model that highlights the role of asymmetric conformations in the ATP-coupled cycle with implications to the mechanism of ABC transporters in general (Tang et al. 2023)."

3.A.1.107.3	"CcmABCD exporter; CcmD (69aas, 1TMS) is required for the release of CcmE (which binds heme in the periplasm) from CcmABC.  CcmC (9.B.14.2.3) is required for the transfer of heme to CcmE in the periplasm (Richard-Fogal et al., 2008) In the presence of heme, CcmC and CcmE form a stable complex (Richard-Fogal & Kranz, 2010) as do CcmE and CcmF (San Francisco and Kranz 2014). The cytochrome c maturation system I, consisting of eight membrane/periplasmic
proteins (CcmABCDEFGH), results in the attachment of heme to cysteine 
residues of cytochrome c proteins. Since all c-type cytochromes are 
periplasmic, heme is first transported to a periplasmic heme chaperone, 
CcmE. A large membrane complex, CcmABCD has been proposed to carry out 
this transport and linkage to CcmE. Li et al. 2022 described high 
resolution cryo-EM structures of CcmABCD in an unbound form, in complex 
with inhibitor AMP-PNP, and in complex with ATP and heme. The 
ATP-binding site in CcmA and the heme-binding site in CcmC were identified. They proposed a
model of heme trafficking, heme transfer to CcmE, and ATP-dependent 
release of holoCcmE from CcmABCD. CcmABCD represents an ABC transporter 
complex using the energy of ATP hydrolysis for the transfer of heme from
 one binding partner (CcmC, see TC# 9.B.14.2.3) to another (CcmE) (Li et al. 2022). It appers that CcmC is in a complex with CcmABD but is not part of the ABC transporter. The same may be true of CcmD (see description above)."	Proteobacteria

3.A.1.112.9	ABC bacteriocin exporter with two peptidase domains, Pcat1. 3-D structures are known (4S0F, 6V9Z, 4RY2). The pathway for peptide export consists of an large α-helical barrel for small folded peptides.  ATP binding alternates access to the transmembrane pathway and reglates protease activity (Lin et al. 2015). Subunit asymmetry of the M3-M4 loops contribute to optimizing AChR activation through allosteric links to the channel and the agonist binding site (Shen et al. 2005). Structures were more recently determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. Two substrate CtAs, 90-residue polypeptides, are bound via their N-terminal leader peptides, but only one is positioned for cleavage and translocation. The structures were determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. It seems that substrate cleavage, ATP hydrolysis, and substrate translocation are coordinated in a transport cycle (Kieuvongngam et al. 2020). The N-terminal C39 peptidase (PEP) domain of PCAT1 processes its natural substrate, CtA, by cleaving a conserved -GG- motif to separate the cargo from the leader peptide prior to secretion. The ATP-mediated association between PEP and the transmembrane domains of PCAT1 offers a putative mechanism to optimize peptide cleavage by regulating the width and flexibility of the enzyme active site (Bhattacharya and Palillo 2021). Structures of the peptidase-containing ABC transporter PCAT1 under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions have been solved (Kieuvongngam and Chen 2022).

Daniel et al. 2018 showed that Rv2477c displays strong ATPase activity (Vmax = 45 nmol/mg/min; Km = 90 muM) that is sensitive to orthovanadate. The ATPase activity was maximal in the presence of Mn2+ at pH 5.2. The protein hydrolyzed GTP, TTP and CTPas well as ATP but at lower rates. Glutamate to glutamine substitutions of amino acid residues 185 and 468 in the two Walker B motifs severely inhibited its ATPase activity. The antibiotics, tetracycline and erythromycin, which target protein translation, were able to inhibit the ATPase activity.

3.A.1.122.1	Macrolide (14- and 15- but not 16-membered lactone macrolides including erythromycin) exporter, MacAB (formerly YbjYZ). Both MacA and MacB are required for activity (Tikhonova et al., 2007). MacAB functions with TolC to export multiple drugs and heat-stable enterotoxin II (enterotoxin STII) (Yamanaka et al., 2008).  The crystal structure of MacA is available (Yum et al., 2009). MacB is a dimer whose ATPase activity and macrolide-binding capacity are regulated by the membrane fusion protein MacA (Lin et al., 2009). Xu et al. (2009) have reported the crystal structure of the periplasmic region of MacB which they claim resembles the periplasmic domain of RND-type transporters such as AcrB (TC# 2.A.6.2.2). Also exports L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). The periplasmic membrane proximal domain of MacA acts as a switch in stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the MacB transporter (Modali and Zgurskaya, 2011). Fitzpatrick et al. 2017 presented an electron cryo-microscopy structure of the tripartite assembly (MacAB-TolC) at near-atomic resolution. A hexamer of the periplasmic protein MacA bridges a TolC trimer in the outer membrane to a MacB dimer in the inner membrane, generating a quaternary structure with a central channel for substrate translocation. A gating ring found in MacA may act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). The structure of ATP-bound MacB has been solved, revealing precise molecular details of its mechanism (Crow et al. 2017). MacB has a fold that is different from other structurally characterized ABC transporters and uses a unique molecular mechanism termed mechanotransmission. Unlike other bacterial ABC transporters, MacB does not transport substrates across the inner membrane in which it is based, but instead couples cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis with transmembrane conformational changes that are used to perform work in the extra-cytoplasmic space. In the MacAB-TolC tripartite pump, mechanotransmission drives efflux of antibiotics and export of a protein toxin from the periplasmic space via the TolC exit duct. Homologous tripartite systems from pathogenic bacteria similarly export protein-like signaling molecules, virulence factors and siderophores (Greene et al. 2018).	Gram-negative bacteria

Some homologues are annotated as ""S-layer domain protein"".  It may be an ABC auxiliary protein.  Most members occur in archaea, but distant homologues are also found in bacteria."	Archaea
3.A.1.122.11	The hemin resistance transporter, HrtAB. Expression is activated by hemin or hemoglobin via the ChrAS transmembrane sensor kinase/response regulator system (Bibb and Schmitt 2010). HrtBA extracts heme from the membrane and expells it.  HrtBA consists of two cytoplasmic HrtA ATPase subunits and two transmembrane HrtB permease subunits. A heme-binding site is formed in the HrtB dimer and is laterally accessible to heme in the outer leaflet of the membrane. The heme-binding site captures heme from the membrane using a glutamate residue of either subunit as an axial ligand and sequesters the heme within the rearranged transmembrane helix bundle. By ATP-driven HrtA dimerization, the heme-binding site is squeezed to extrude the bound heme (Nakamura et al. 2022).	Bacteria

3.A.1.122.14	ABC transporter of unknown function, but aspects of its structure and mechanism of action are known (Yuan et al. 2001; Zoghbi and Altenberg 2013).  Nucleotide-binding domain dimerization occurs as a result of binding to the natural nucleotide triphosphates, ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP, as well as the analog ATP-gamma-S. All the natural nucleotide triphosphates are hydrolyzed at similar rates, whereas ATP-gamma-S is not hydrolyzed. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, frequently assumed to produce the nucleotide-bound conformation, failed to elicit nucleotide-binding domain dimerization (Fendley et al. 2016).	Archaea

The dimeric MacAB adopts a non-canonical fold, the transmembrane domain of which consists of a dimer with eight tightly packed TMSs (4 per subunit) with an extracellular domain between the first and second helices, whereas Spr0693 (the MFP) forms a nanotube channel docked onto the ABC transporter. Structural analyses, combined with ATPase activity and antimicrobial susceptibility assays, enabled the proposal of a putative substrate-entrance tunnel with lateral access controlled by a guard helix (Yang et al. 2018).

3.A.1.122.35	"The MacAB drug exporter.  MacB is an ABC transporter that collaborates with the MacA adaptor 
protein (a membrane fusion protein, MFP) and the TolC exit duct to drive efflux of antibiotics and 
enterotoxin STII out of the bacterial cell. Crow et al. 2017 presented the 
structure of ATP-bound MacB and reveal precise molecular details of its 
mechanism. The MacB transmembrane domain lacks a central cavity through 
which substrates could be passed, but instead conveys conformational 
changes from one side of the membrane to the other, a process termed mechanotransmission. Comparison of 
ATP-bound and nucleotide-free states revealed how reversible dimerization
 of the nucleotide binding domains drives opening and closing of the 
MacB periplasmic domains via concerted movements of the second 
transmembrane segment and the major coupling helix. They proposed that the 
assembled tripartite pump acts as a molecular bellows to propel 
substrates through the TolC exit duct, driven by MacB 
mechanotransmission. Homologs of MacB that do not form tripartite pumps,
 but share structural features underpinning mechanotransmission, include
 the LolCDE lipoprotein trafficking complex and FtsEX cell division 
signaling protein. The MacB architecture serves as a blueprint for 
understanding the structure and mechanism of an entire ABC transporter

3.A.1.125.1	Lipoprotein translocation system (translocates lipoproteins from the inner membrane to periplasmic chaperone, LolA, which transfers the lipoproteins to an outer membrane receptor, LolB, which anchors the lipoprotein to the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope) (see 1.B.46; Narita et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007). The structure of ligand-bound LolCDE has been solved (Ito et al., 2006). LolC and LolE each have 4 TMSs (1+3). Unlike most ATP binding cassette transporters mediating the transmembrane flux of substrates, the LolCDE complex catalyzes the extrusion of lipoproteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. The LolCDE complex is unusual in that it can be purified as a liganded form, which is an intermediate of the lipoprotein release reaction (Taniguchi and Tokuda, 2008). LolCDE has been reconstituted from separated subunits (Kanamaru et al., 2007).  LolE binds the outer membrane lipoprotein, PAL (Mizutani et al. 2013). The mechanism of LolCDE as a molecular extruder of bacterial triacylated lipoproteins has been reported (Sharma et al. 2021) who determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc-embedded LolCDE in the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound states at 3.8-Å and 3.5-Å resolution, respectively. The structural analyses, together with biochemical and mutagenesis studies, uncovered how LolCDE recognizes its substrate by interacting with the lipid and N-terminal peptide moieties of the lipoprotein, and identify the amide-linked acyl chain as the key element for LolCDE interaction. Upon nucleotide binding, the transmembrane helices and the periplasmic domains of LolCDE undergo large-scale, asymmetric movements, resulting in extrusion of the captured lipoprotein. Comparison of LolCDE and MacB revealed the conserved mechanism of type VII ABC transporters and emphasized the unique properties of LolCDE as a molecule extruder of triacylated lipoproteins (Sharma et al. 2021).

Second, there is an ABC-type ATPase (I2F7A6) and third, there is a possible auxiliary subunit of 183 aas and 4 TMSs in a 2 + 2 TMS arrangement that appears to be two repeated 2 TMS sequences, one near the N-terminus and one near the C-terminus; I2F7A5).  Adjacent to these genes is one annotated as a ""PRC barrel protein"" (with a single N-terminal TMS and is a conserved, ubiquitous, chromo domain, shared by photosynthetic reaction center subunits and proteins of RNA metabolism (Anantharaman and Aravind 2002); I2F7A4) of unknown function, and adjacent to that gene are two genes encoding putative chromate resistance efflux (transport) protein, ChrA (I2F7A3 and I2F7A1; see TC family 2.A.51)."

3.A.1.129.1	"Heme transporter (previously proposed to be a thiol (cysteine/glutathione) exporter, CydDC; CydC is also called MdrH (periplasmic cysteine is required for cytochrome bd assembly) (Cruz-Ramos et al., 2004).  The purified asymmetric heterodimer exhibits low ATPase activity which is activated by both thiols and heme (e.g., heme b) (Yamashita et al. 2014).  Bacterial redox homoeostasis during nitrosative stress is influenced by CydDC.  Periplasmic low molecular weight thiols restore haem incorporation into a cytochrome complex (Holyoake et al. 2016). Iron-bound cyclic tetrapyrroles (hemes) are redox-active cofactors in 
bioenergetic enzymes. Wu et al. 2023 used
 cellular, biochemical, structural and computational methods to 
characterize CydDC which is a 
heme transporter required for functional maturation of cytochrome bd. The conformational 
landscape of CydDC during substrate binding and occlusion was revealed. Heme binds laterally from the membrane space to 
the transmembrane region of CydDC, enabled by a highly asymmetrical 
inward-facing CydDC conformation. During the binding process, heme 
propionates interact with positively charged residues on the surface and
 later in the substrate-binding pocket of the transporter, causing the 
heme orientation to rotate 180° (Wu et al. 2023)."	Bacteria

3.A.1.13.1	"Vitamin B12 porter. The 3-D structure of BtuCDF has been solved to 2.6 Å (Hvorup et al., 2007). The conformational transition pathways of BtuCD has been revealed by targeted molecular dynamics simulations (Weng et al., 2012). Asymmetric states of BtuCD are not discriminated by its cognate substrate binding protein BtuF (Korkhov et al., 2012).  ATP hydrolysis occurs at the nucleotide-binding domain
(NBD) dimer interface, whereas substrate translocation takes place at the
translocation pathway between the TM subunits, which is more than 30 angstroms away
from the NBD dimer interface.  Hydrolysis of ATP appears to facilitate substrate translocation by opening the
cytoplasmic end of translocation pathway (Pan et al. 2016). The molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by BtuCD-F may proceeds in a stepwise manner (Prieß et al. 2018). First, nucleophilic attack of an activated lytic water molecule at the ATP gamma-phosphate yields ADP + HPO42-. A conserved glutamate located close to the gamma-phosphate transiently accepts a proton acting as a catalytic base. In the second step, the proton transfers back from the catalytic base to the gamma-phosphate, yielding ADP + H2PO4-. These two reaction steps are followed by rearrangements of the hydrogen bond network and the coordination of the Mg2+ ion. The overall free energy change of the reaction is close to zero, suggesting that ATP binding is essential for tight dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains and the transition of the transmembrane domains from inward- to outward-facing. ATP hydrolysis resets the conformational cycle (Prieß et al. 2018)."	Proteobacteria

 2.0 Å and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively, and they show distinct ligand 
binding pockets. In vitro ligand binding experiments for FecB and FecB2 
were performed with heme and bacterial siderophores from Mtb and other 
species, revealing that both FecB and FecB2 bind heme, while only FecB 
binds the Mtb sideophore ferric-carboxymycobactin (Fe-cMB). Subsequent

3.A.1.140.1	The FtsX/FtsE ABC transporter (Arends et al., 2009) (FtsX is of the type III topology). FtsEX directly recruits EnvC to the septum via an interaction between EnvC and a periplasmic loop of FtsX. FtsEX variants predicted to be ATPase defective still recruit EnvC to the septum but fail to promote cell separation. Amidase activation via EnvC in the periplasm is regulated by conformational changes in the FtsEX complex mediated by ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. Since FtsE has been reported to interact with FtsZ, amidase activity may be coupled with the contraction of the FtsZ cytoskeletal ring (Yang et al., 2011).	Bacteria

3.A.1.15.14	"High affinity Mn2+ uptake complex, PsaABC (Lisher et al. 2013). The crystal structure of the manganese transporter PsaBC from Streptococcus pneumoniae has been solved in an open-inward conformation (Neville et al. 2021). The type II transporter has a tightly closed transmembrane channel due to ""extracellular gating"" residues that prevent water permeation and ion reflux. Below these residues, the channel contains a metal coordination site, which is essential for manganese translocation. Mutagenesis of the extracellular gate perturbs manganese uptake, while coordination site mutagenesis abolishes import. These structural features are well conserved in metal-specific ABC transporters and are represented throughout the kingdoms of life. Collectively, these results define the structure of PsaBC and reveal the features required for divalent cation transport (Neville et al. 2021)."	Firmicutes

3.A.1.15.21	Mn2+ ABC uptake system, MntABC. Titratable transmembrane residues and a hydrophobic plug are essential for manganese import via the Bacillus anthracis ABC transporter MntBC-A (Kuznetsova et al. 2021). Zinc is a high-affinity inhibitor. The transmembrane metal permeation pathway is lined with six titratable residues that can coordinate the positively charged metal, and mutagenesis studies showed that they are essential for manganese transport. Modelling suggested that access to these titratable residues is blocked by a ladder of hydrophobic residues, and ATP-driven conformational changes open and close this hydrophobic seal to permit metal binding and release. The conservation of this arrangement of titratable and hydrophobic residues among ABC transporters of transition metals suggests a common mechanism (Kuznetsova et al. 2021).

3.A.1.152.1	"LPS export system, LptF (M), LptG (M) and LptB (C).  This system is also listed in TCDB under TC#1.B.42.1.2 as part of a multicomponent system.  The entire system is described in detail there. LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa.
 It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM 
domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling 
helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and 
LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. 
Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity 
laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is
 expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and 
hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction
 by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). LptB2FG extracts LPS from the periplasmic face of the IM through a pair of lateral gates and then powers transperiplasmic transport to the OM through a slide formed by either of the periplasmic domains of LptF or LptG, LptC, LptA and the N-terminal domain of LptD. The structural and functional studies of the seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins provide a platform to explore the unusual mechanisms of LPS extraction, transport and insertion from the inner membrane to the outer membrane (Dong et al. 2017). LptB2 binds novobiocin which stimulates its export activity and renders the membrane more impermeable to novobiocin (May et al. 2017)."

The two membrane proteins are of 360 and 380 aas with 6 TMSs in a 3 + 3 TMS arrangement, separated by a large hydrophilic loop. Members of this family often work together with outer membrane proteins of TC family 1.B.42, and some of these outer membrane proteins are fused to one of the subunites of these systems.

3.A.1.152.2	Putative ABC exporter of the YjgP/Q (LptFG) family.  The membrane protein has 772 aas and 12 TMSs in a (3 + 3)2 duplicated topology.  The gene adjacent to this membrane protein gene encodes an ABC1 ATPase of 583 aas and 6 N-terminal TMSs with a C-terminal ATPase domain. Most ATPases of family 3.A.1.152 are of the ABC2-type. Thus, it is unlikely that this protein serves to energized the YjgP/Q-dependent transport process.

3.A.1.152.9	Lipopolysaccharide transporter that exports LPS from the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane, LptB2FG. The 134-kDa protein complex is unique among ABC transporters because it extracts lipopolysaccharide from the external leaflet of the inner membrane and propels it along a filament that extends across the periplasm to directly deliver lipopolysaccharide into the external leaflet of the outer membrane. Dong et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of this transporter in which both LptF and LptG are composed of a beta-jellyroll-like periplasmic domain and six TMSs. LptF and LptG together form a central cavity containing highly conserved hydrophobic residues. Structural and functional studies suggest that LptB2FG uses an alternating lateral access mechanism to extract lipopolysaccharide and traffic it along the hydrophobic cavity toward the transporter's periplasmic domains. The structure has been presented by Dong et al. 2017. LPS transport involves long-ranging bi- directional coupling across cellular compartments between cytoplasmic LptB and periplasmic regions of the Lpt transporter (Lundstedt et al. 2020). LPS transport from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM is achieved by seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins (LptA-G). LptB2FG, a type VI ABC transporter, forms a stable complex with LptC, extracts LPS from the IM and powers LPS transport to the OM. Luo et al. 2021 reported the cryo-EM structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC from Klebsiella pneumoniae in complex with LPS. The LptB2FG-LPS structure provides detailed interactions between LPS and the transporter, while the LptB2FGC-LPS structure may represent an intermediate state in which the transmembrane helix of LptC has not been fully inserted into the transmembrane domains of LptB2FG (Luo et al. 2021).

3.A.1.153.1	"ABC transporter complex YtrBCD that may play a role in acetoin utilization during stationary phase and sporulation (Yoshida et al. 2000). Expression is induced early in the stationary phase. The six ytr  genes form a single operon, transcribed from a promoter present upstream of ytrA. YtrA, which 
possesses a helix-turn-helix motif of the GntR family, may be a
 repressor that regulates its own transcription as well as the whole operon. Inactivation of the 
operon led to a decrease in the maximal cell yield and less-efficient 
sporulation. B. subtilis produces acetoin as 
an external carbon storage compound and then reuses it later during 
stationary phase and sporulation. Possibly the Ytr porter plays a role (Yoshida et al. 2000). The YtrEF system, believed to be a distinct ABC efflux system (M.

3.A.1.201.1	"Broad specificity multidrug resistance (MDR1; MDR-1; Pgp; P-gp; ABCB1; P-glycoprotein) efflux pump. It exports organic cations and amphiphilic compounds of unrelated chemical structure.  These include: antibiotics, anti-viral agents, cancer chemotheraputic agents, hypertensives, depressants, histamines, emetics, and the protease inhibitor, lopinavir. Pgp also exports immunosuppressants, detergents, long-chain fatty acids, HIV protease inhibitors, synthetic tetramethylrosamine analogues, calcein M, etc.); it is also a peptide efflux pump, and peptide inhibitors have been designed (Tarasova et al. 2005). It is also a phospholipid (e.g., phosphatidyl serine), cholesterol and sterol flippase. It binds and probably transports inhibitors and agonists of SUR (3.A.1.208.4) (Bessadok et al., 2011). Modulatory effects of inhibitory amlodipine and tamoxifen on P-glycoprotein efflux activities have been studied (Darvari and Boroujerdi 2004). The 3-d structure has been determined (Aller et al., 2009). It can pump from the cytoplasmic leaflet to either the outer leaflet or the outer medium (Katzir et al., 2010). The inhibitor, 5''-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5''-adenosine, an ATP analogue, interacts with both drug-substrate- and nucleotide-binding sites (Ohnuma et al., 2011). Inhibited by sildenafil (Shi et al., 2011), verapamil, indomethacin, probenecid, cetirizine (He et al. 2010), and lapatinib derivatives (Sodani et al., 2012), several of which are also substrates. HG-829 is a potent non-competitive inhibitor (Caceres et al., 2012).  Berberine, palmatine, jateorhizine, cetirizine and coptisine are all P-gp substrates, and cyclosporin A and verapamil are potent inhibitors (He et al. 2010; Zhang et al., 2011).  Transports clarithromycin (CAM), a macrolide antibiotic used to treat lung infections, more effectively than azithromycin (AZM) or telithromycin (TEL) (Togami et al. 2012).  Nucleotides, lipids and drugs bind synergistically to the pump (Marcoux et al. 2013).  Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013).  The central cavity undergoes alternating access during ATP hydrolysis (van Wonderen et al. 2014).  Structural data suggest that signals are transduced through
intracellular loops of the TMSs that slot into grooves on the NBDs. The Q loops at the base of these grooves are required to couple drug binding to the ATP catalytic cycle of drug export (Zolnerciks et al. 2014). Ocotillol analogues are strong competitive inhibitors (Zhang et al. 2015).  Durmus et al. 2015 have reviewed PGP transport of cancer chemotheraputic agents.  ABCB1 variants modulate therapeutic responses to modafinil
and may partly explain pharmacoresistance in Narcolepse type 1 (NT1) patients (Moresco et al. 2016).  Many inhibitors have been identified (Hemmer et al. 2015).  The open-and-close
motion of the protein alters the surface topology of P-gp within the drug-binding pocket,
explaining its polyspecificity (Esser et al. 2016). The ATP- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of the mouse Pgp transporter have been defined, showing that the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is harnessed in the NBDs in a two-stroke cycle (Verhalen et al. 2017).  Rilpivirine inhibits MDR1- and BCRP-mediated efflux of abacavir and increases its transmembrane transport (Reznicek et al. 2017).  It transports Huerzine A in the brain, a drug that is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Li et al. 2017). AbcB1 acts in concert with ABCA1, ABCG2 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-β 
peptide (Aβ) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018).The structure has been determined with the ABCB1 inhibitor, zosuquidar, bound.  This structure reveals the transporter in an occluded conformation with a central, enclosed, inhibitor-binding pocket lined by residues from all TMSs. The pocket spans almost the entire width of the lipid membrane and is occupied exclusively by two closely interacting zosuquidar molecules (Alam et al. 2018).  Iit is also inhibited by dacomitinib (Fan et al. 2018). Moreover, Kim and Chen 2018 presented the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing 
conformation, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.4-Å 
resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer 
occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the 
inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space 
and is compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates
 that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release (Kim and Chen 2018). P-gp also transports opioid peptides (Ganapathy and Miyauchi 2005). MDR1 has been quantified in primary human renal cell carcinoma cells and corresponding normal tissue, and down-regulation or expression loss was documented in tumor tissues, corroborating its importance in drug resistance and efficacy (Poetz et al. 2018). Regarding the conformational transitions, first the transition is driven by the NBDs, then transmitted to the cytoplasmic parts of TMSs, and finally to the periplasmic parts. The trajectories show that besides the translational motions, the NBDs undergo a rotation movement (Zhang et al. 2018). Isoxanthohumol is a substrate and competitive inhibitor which reverses ABCB1-mediated doxorubicin resistance (Liu et al. 2017). Tariquidar is a potent inhibitor, even when taken orally (Matzneller et al. 2018). Combined oral administration of the ovarian hormones, ethinyl estradiol and progesterone, significantly lowered both MDR-1 mRNA and MDR-1 protein in the ovary (Brayboy et al. 2018). Its expression in immune cells plays a protective role from xenobiotics and toxins (Bossennec et al. 2018). Oxypeucedanin reverses P-gp-mediated drug transport by inhibition of P-gp activity and P-gp protein expression as well as downregulation of P-gp mRNA levels (Dong et al. 2018). Alam et al. 2019 determined the 3.5-Å cryo-EM
structure of substrate-bound human ABCB1 reconstituted in lipidic 
nanodiscs, revealing a single molecule of the chemotherapeutic compound 
paclitaxel (Taxol) bound in a central, occluded pocket. A second 
structure of inhibited, human-mouse chimeric ABCB1 revealed two 
molecules of zosuquidar occupying the same drug-binding pocket. Minor 
structural differences between substrate- and inhibitor-bound ABCB1 
sites are amplified toward the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), 
revealing how the plasticity of the drug-binding site controls the 
dynamics of the ATP-hydrolyzing NBDs. Ordered 
cholesterol and phospholipid molecules suggest how the membrane 
modulates the conformational changes associated with drug binding and 
transport (Alam et al. 2019). The TMS4/6 cleft may be an energetically favorable entrance gate for ligand entry into the binding pocket of P-gp (Xing et al. 2019). The epigallocatechin gallate derivative Y6 reverses drug resistance mediated by ABCB1 (Wen et al. 2019). Substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with 
stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized 
by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites, but this 
state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity 
inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites (Dastvan et al. 2019). It transports temozolomide (TMZ) which is used as a treatment of glioblasomas (Malmström et al. 2019). Unconventional cholesterol translocation on the surface of Pgp provides a secondary transport model for the known flippase activity of ABC exporters of cholesterol (Thangapandian et al. 2020). An in silico multiclass classification model capable of predicting the probability of a compound to interact with P-gp has been developed using a counter-propagation artificial neural network (CP ANN) based on a set of 2D molecular descriptors, as well as an extensive dataset of 2512 compounds (1178 P-gp inhibitors, 477 P-gp substrates and 857 P-gp non-active compounds) (Mora Lagares et al. 2019).  Jervine is a natural teratogenic compound isolated from Veratrum californicum. Liu et al. 2019 showed that jervine sensitizes the anti-proliferation effect of doxorubicin (DOX) and that the synergistic mechanism was related to the intracellular accumulation of DOX via modulating ABCB1 transport. Jervine did not affect the expression of ABCB1 in mRNA or protein levels. However, jervine increased the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and probably served as a substrate of ABCB1. Jervine binds to a closed ABCB1 conformation and blocks drug entrance to the central binding site at the transmembrane domain (Liu et al. 2019). 6-Triazolyl-substituted sulfocoumarins inhibit P-gp (Podolski-Renić et al. 2019). ATP binding causes the conformational change to the outward-facing state, and ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of γ-phosphate from both NBDs allow the outward-facing state to return to the original inward-facing state (Futamata et al. 2020). Replacing the eleven native tryptophans by directed evolution produces an active P-glycoprotein with site-specific, non-conservative substitutions (Swartz et al. 2020). ABCB1 polymorphisms alter P-gp-mediated drug (sunitinib) sensitivities. Homology modeling provided insight into ligand binding through molecular docking studies (Mora Lagares et al. 2020). Sitravatinib  reverses MDR mediated by ABCB1 and partially antagonized ABCC10-mediated MDR (Yang et al. 2020). Apiole from parsley blocks the active P-gp site, with strong binding energy, which, in turn, inhibits doxorubicin and vincristine efflux, increasing the antiproliferative response of these chemotherapeutic agents (Afonso de Lima et al. 2020). The mechanisms of action of synthetic, potent, small molecule P-gp inhibitors have been reviewed (Zhang et al. 2020). ATP binding to the open NBDs and ATP hydrolysis in the closed NBD dimer represent two steps of energy input, each leading to the formation of a high energy state. Relaxation from these high energy states occurs through conformational changes that push ABCB1 through the transport cycle (Szöllősi et al. 2020). 14 conserved residues (seven in both TMsSs 6 and 12) were substituted with alanine and generated a mutant termed 14A (Sajid et al. 2020). Although the 14A mutant lost the ability to pump most of the substrates tested out of cancer cells, it was able to import four substrates, including rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and the taxol derivative flutax-1. Similar to the efflux function of wild-type P-gp, uptake was ATP hydrolysis-, substrate concentration-, and time-dependent. Further mutagenesis identified residues in both TMSs 6 and 12 that synergistically form a switch in the central region of the two helices that governs whether a given substrate is pumped out of or into the cell (Sajid et al. 2020). Helix repacking may be the basis for P-glycoprotein promiscuity (Bonito et al. 2020). The use of carbon nano-onion-mediated dual targeting of P-selectin and P-glycoprotein has been shown to overcome cancer drug resistance (Wang et al. 2021). A sequentially responsive Nnanosystem breaches cascaded bio-barriers and suppresses P-Glycoprotein function for reversing cancer drug resistance (Liu et al. 2020). Lys-268 and the cytoplasmic end of TMS5 may comprise a drug binding site (Demmer et al. 2021). MDR1 protein (ABC-C1) is overexpressed in Giardia intestinalis following incubation with the drugs, albendazole and nitazoxanide (Ángeles-Arvizu et al. 2021). The human P-gp is inhibited by benzophenone sulfonamide derivatives (Farman et al. 2020) and androstano-arylpyrimidines (Gopisetty et al. 2021), and possibly by tepoxalin (McQuerry et al. 2021). The inward facing state of P-glycoprotein in a lipid membrane has been confirmed (Carey Hulyer et al. 2020). For transmembrane pharmaceutical drug transport, non-specific trans-phospholipid bilayer transport may be negligible (Kell 2021). Glabratephrin reverses doxorubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (Abd-Ellatef et al. 2021). In silico screening of c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting nucleotide and drug-substrate binding sites of ABCB1 are potential MDR reversal agents (Moosavi et al. 2022). Quercetin acts as a P-gp modulator via impeding signal transduction from the nucleotide-binding domain to the transmembrane domain (Singh et al. 2022). MDR1 promotes intrinsic and acquired resistance to PROTACs in cancer cells and exports the antiseizure drug, levetiracetam (Behmard et al. 2022). Air pollution exposure increases ABCB1 and ASCT1 transporter levels in mouse cortex (Puris et al. 2022). MDR-1 dysfunction perturbs meiosis and Ca2+ homeostasis in oocytes (Nabi et al. 2022). The P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter has been modelled with in silico methods (Mora Lagares and Novič 2022). A new ABCB1 inhibitor enhances the anticancer effect of doxorubicin in models of  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Adorni et al. 2023). A homologous series of amphiphiles interact with P-glycoprotein in a membrane environment, and the contributions of polar and non-polar interactions has been estimated (Moreno et al. 2023). TRIP6 transcription is regulated primarily by the cyclic AMP 
response element (CRE) in hypomethylated proximal promoters in both 
taxane-sensitive and taxane-resistant MCF-7 cells. In 
taxane-resistant MCF-7 sublines, TRIP6 co-amplifies with the neighboring ABCB1 gene (Daniel et al. 2023). Inhibition of Cryptosporidium parvum by nitazoxanide (NTZ) and paclitaxel (PTX) has been validated (Yang et al. 2023). New inhibitors of ABCB1 have been identified (Cheema et al. 2023). Inhibitors of MDR pumps (MDR1, MRP1/2 and BCRP) have been described (Kaproń et al. 2023). A hyaluronic acid modified cuprous metal-organic complex reverses multidrug resistance via redox dyshomeostasis (Wan et al. 2023; Duan et al. 2023). The high sensitivity of the steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate to the 
nature and number of dipolar interactions, as well as to the dielectric 
constant of the membrane, points to a flopping process, which occurs to a
 large extent at the membrane-transporter interface (Seelig and Li-Blatter 2023). ABCB1, NCF4, and GSTP1 polymorphisms predicted lower hematological toxicity during induction, while ABCB1 and CRBN polymorphisms predicted lower risk of grade >/=3 infections (Ferrero et al. 2023). Wine-processed Chuanxiong Rhizoma enhances the efficacy of aumolertinib 
against EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer xenografts in nude mouse 
brain (Niu et al. 2023). The efflux of anti-psychotics through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via this system has been demonstrated (Nasyrova et al. 2023). Residues from homologous TMSs 4 and 10 are critical for P-glycoprotein (ABCB1)-mediated drug transport (Rahman et al. 2023). Emamectin B1a, Emamectin B1b, Vincristine, Vinblastine, and Vindesine are promising ABCB1 inhibitors that can reverse MDR (Ibrahim et al. 2023). Other substrates and inhibitors from Anemarrhenae rhizoma have been identified (Dai et al. 2022).  Peptides and their analogs can cross the BBB by transmembrane diffusion, saturable transport, and adsorptive transcytosis (Banks 2023). Saturable transport systems are adaptable to physiologic changes and can be altered by disease states. In particular, transport across the BBB of insulin and of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) illustrate many of the concepts regarding peptide transport across the BBB (Banks 2023).  Second-site suppressor mutations reveal connections between the drug-binding pocket and the nucleotide-binding domain 1 of human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) (Murakami et al. 2023).  Betulin derivatives are multidrug reversal agents targeting P-glycoprotein (Laiolo et al. 2024). Deaggregation of mutant Plasmodium yoelii de-ubiquitinase UBP1 alters MDR1 localization to confer multidrug resistance (Xu et al. 2024)."	Animals, fungi, bacteria

This protein is similar in sequence to Ste6-2b  of Pichia pastoralis the structure of which has been solved by cryoEM. It transports rodamines 6G and 123, Dvarapamil, flconazole, and itraconazole, and it's ATPase activity is inhibited by terbinafine, niftifine, ketoconazole and asmorilfine, It also appears to interact with sterols (Schleker et al. 2022).

3.A.1.201.2	Bile salt export pump, BSEP, ABCB11 or SPGP in the canalicular membrane of liver cells, is associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-2 and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (Kagawa et al., 2008; Stindt et al. 2013; Park et al. 2016). It exports unconjugaged bile salts and glycine conjugates > taurine conjugates as well as the statin, pravastatin (Nigam 2015). BSEP mediates biliary excretion of bile acids from hepatocytes. Compounds based on GW4064 (Q96RI1), a representative farnesoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, enhance E297G BSEP transport activity (Misawa et al., 2012). Rescue of bile acid transport by ABCB11 variants by CFTR potentiators has been extensively documented as a possible treatment for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-2 (Mareux et al. 2022).  BSEP is expressed in hepatocytes and extrudes bile salts into the canaliculi of the liver. BSEP dysfunction, caused by mutations or induced by drugs is frequently associated with severe cholestatic liver disease. Liu et al. 2023 reported the cryo-EM structure of glibenclamide-bound human BSEP in nanodiscs, revealing the basis of small-molecule inhibition. Glibenclamide binds the apex of a central binding pocket between the transmembrane domains, preventing BSEP from undergoing conformational changes, and thus rationalizing the reduced uptake of bile salts. Two high-resolution structures of BSEP trapped in distinct nucleotide-bound states by using a catalytically inactivated BSEP variant (BSEP(E1244Q)) to visualize a pre-hydrolysis state, and wild-type BSEP trapped by vanadate to visualize a post-hydrolysis state. These studies provide structural and functional insight into the mechanism of bile salt extrusion and into small-molecule inhibition of BSEP, which may rationalize drug-induced liver toxicity (Liu et al. 2023).

3.A.1.201.20	12 TMS multidrug resistance transprter of 1318 aas, AbcB15 (Xiong et al. 2010) is the probable exporter of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).  Expression is induced by treatment with DDT, and this transporter appears to be responsible for DDT tolerance by pumping it out of the cell (Ning et al. 2014).	Alveolata (Ciliates)
3.A.1.201.21	Half sized ABCB1 drug (verapamil; rhodamine 6G) exporter of specificity similar to that of P-glycoprotein (3.A.1.201.1).  The 3-d structures of the unbound (2.6 Å) and the allosteric inhibitor-bound (2.4 Å) forms have been determined (Kodan et al. 2014).  The outward opening motion is required for ATP hydrolysis. Kodan et al. 2019 have reported a pair of structures of this homodimeric P-glycoprotein: an outward-facing conformational state with bound nucleotide, and an inward-facing apo state, at resolutions of 1.9 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. Features that can be clearly visualized include ATP binding with octahedral coordination of Mg2+; an inner chamber that significantly changes in volume with the aid of tight connections among TMSs 1, 3, and 6; a glutamate-arginine interaction that stabilizes the outward-facing conformation; and extensive interactions between TMS1 and TMS3, a property that distinguishes multidrug transporters from floppases (Kodan et al. 2019). The crystal structure of the CmABCB1 G132V mutant, which favors the outward-facing state, reveals the mechanism of the pivotal joint between TMS1 and TMS3 (Matsuoka et al. 2021). The crystal structure of this CmABCB1 multi-drug exporter in lipidic mesophase has been revealed by LCP-SFX, suggesting flexibility of the substrate exit region of the protein (Pan et al. 2022).  Structure-based alteration of tryptophan residues of CmABCB1 allows assessment of substrate binding using fluorescence spectroscopy (Inoue et al. 2022).

3.A.1.201.22	Mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette 1, ABCB8.  Mediates doxorubicin resistance in melanoma cells (Elliott and Al-Hajj 2009). It is regulated by the Sp1 transcription factor and down regulated by mthramycin A which blocks Sp1 binding to the DNA (Sachrajda and Ratajewski 2011). It is also regulated by neuropilin-1, NRP1 (TC# 8.A.47.1.5) (Issitt et al. 2018). The cryo-EM structure of ABCB8 bound to AMPPNP in the inward-facing conformation was solved with a resolution of 4.1 Å. hABCB8 shows an open-inward conformation when ATP is bound, and cholesterol molecules were identified in the transmembrane domain of hABCB8 (Li et al. 2021).

It is essential for early development, probably because Drosophila germ cell migration depends on lipid-modified peptides that are secreted by MDR49  (Ricardo and Lehmann 2009).

Overexpression of LtrMDR1 increases miltefosine efflux, leading to a decrease in drug accumulation in the parasites and resistance (Pérez-Victoria et al. 2006).	MDR1 of Leishmania major
3.A.1.201.27	Multidrug resistance exporter of 1331 aas and 12 TMSs, TratrD or MDR2.

Displays increased levels of transcription of the TruMDR2 gene when mycelia were exposed to acriflavine, benomyl, ethidium bromide, ketoconazole, chloramphenicol, griseofulvin, fluconazole, imazalil, itraconazole, methotrexate, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO) or tioconazole. Disruption of the TruMDR2 gene rendered the mutant more sensitive to terbinafine, 4NQO and ethidium bromide than the control strain, suggesting that this transporter plays a role in modulating drug susceptibility in T. rubrum (Fachin et al. 2006).

3.A.1.201.3	Short chain fatty acid phosphatidylcholine translocase (phospholipid flippase), MDR3; AbcB4; Pgy3.  ABCB4 regulates the secretion into bile of phosphatidylcholine (PC), while ABCG5/G8 is active in the excretion of cholesterol and sterols into bile. It is associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) (Degiorgio et al. 2007) and progressive intrafamilial hepatic disease (Quazi and Molday, 2011)). ABCB4 exhibits narrow drug specificity relative to MDR1 but exports digoxin, paclitaxel, vinblastin and bile acids. It regulates phosphatidylcholine secretion into bile and its translocation across the plasma membrane in hepatocytes (Voloshyna and Reiss, 2011; Kluth et al. 2014) and functions as a floppase (Sakamoto et al. 2019). The cryo-EM structure trapped in an ATP-bound state at a resolution of 3.2 Å has been described (Olsen et al. 2019). The nucleotide binding domains form a closed conformation containing two bound ATP molecules, but only one of the ATPase sites contains bound Mg2+. The transmembrane domains adopt a collapsed conformation at the level of the lipid bilayer, but a large, hydrophilic and fully occluded cavity at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane boundary, with no ligand bound, is present. This indicates a state following substrate release but prior to ATP hydrolysis. These results rationalize disease-causing mutations in human ABCB4 and suggest an 'alternating access' mechanism of lipid extrusion, distinct from the 'credit card swipe' model of other lipid transporters (Olsen et al. 2019). An in vitro assay to investigate ABCB4 transport function has been developed (Temesszentandrási-Ambrus et al. 2023).	Animals

3.A.1.202.1	"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (also called ABCC7); cyclic AMP-dependent chloride channel; also catalyzes nucleotide (ATP-ADP)-dependent glutathione and glutathione-conjugate flux (Kogan et al., 2003) (may also activate inward rectifying K+ channels). The underlying mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis controls channel  opening is described by Gadsby et al., 2006. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is defective folding of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant lacking Phe508 (DeltaF508) (Riordan, 2008). The DeltaF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane segments, a defect that can be repaired by direct interaction with correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 (Wang et al., 2007). CFTR interacts directly with MRP4 (3.A.1.208.7) to control Cl- secretion (Li et al., 2007). It has intrinsic adenylate kinase activity that may be of functional importance (Randak and Welsh, 2007). The intact CFTR protein mediates ATPase rather than adenylate kinase activity (Ramjeesingh et al., 2008). Regulated by Na+/H+ exchange regulatory cofactors (NHERF; O14745; TC #8.A.24.1.1) (Seidler et al., 2009). Regulated by protein kinase A and C phosphorylation (Csanády et al., 2010). It is also activated by membrane stretch induced by negative pressures (Zhang et al., 2010). TMS6 plays roles in gating and permeation (Bai et al., 2010; 2011). The 3-D structure revealed the probable location of the channel gate (Rosenberg et al., 2011). Conformational changes opening the CFTR chloride channel pore, coupled to ATP-dependent gating, have been studied (Wang and Linsdell, 2012). Alternating access to the transmembrane domain of CFTR has been demonstrated (Wang and Linsdell, 2012). MRP4 and CFTR function in the regulation of cAMP and beta-adrenergic contraction in cardiac myocytes (Sellers et al., 2012). An asymmetric hourglass, comprising a shallow outward-facing vestibule that tapers toward a narrow ""bottleneck"" linking the outer vestibule to a large inner cavity extending toward the cytoplasmic extent of the lipid bilayer has been proposed (Norimatsu et al., 2012). Small molecule CFTR potentiators and correctors that overcome the efects of deleterious mutations have been identified (Kym et al. 2018).  The intracellular processing, trafficking, apical membrane localization,
 and channel function of CFTR are regulated by dynamic protein-protein 
interactions in a complex network. Zhang et al. 2017 reviewed the macromolecular complex of CFTR, Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger 
regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2; TC# 8.A.24.1.2), and lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) receptor 2
 (LPA2; see TC# 9.A.14.2.5) at the apical plasma membrane of airway and gut epithelial cells.  The structure, gating and regulation of the CFTR anion channel has been reviewed (Csanády et al. 2019). Mutants impairing ion conductance giving rise to CF, are partially corrected using the drug ivacaftor, and the structure of CFTR bound to this drug, which keeps the channel open has been solved by cryoEM (Liu et al. 2019). The drug binds to a site with a hinge involved in channel gating. CFTR modulators
 reduce agonist-induced platelet activation and function; modulators, such as ivacaftor, present a promising therapeutic strategy for thrombocytopathies, including severe COVID-19 (Asmus et al. 2023). Chronic hypoxia reduces the activities of epithelial sodium and CFTR ion channels (Wong et al. 2023).  CFTR function on ex vivo nasal epithelial cell models has been evaluated (Terlizzi et al. 2023). The therapeutic potential of phytochemicals for cystic fibrosis has been considered, and curcumin, genistein, and resveratrol have been shown to be effective.  These compounds  have beneficial effects on transporter 
function, transmembrane conductivity, and overall channel activity (Baharara et al. 2023). VX-661 and VX-445 exert effects on the plasma membrane expression of clinical CFTR variants (McKee et al. 2023). The Cl--transporting proteins CFTR, SLC26A9 (TC# 2.A.53.2.15), and anoctamins
(ANO1; ANO6) (TC#s 1.A.17.1.1 and 1.4) appear to have more in common than initially suspected, as 
they all participate in the pathogenic process and clinical outcomes of 
airway and renal diseases in humans. Kunzelmann et al. 2023 reviewed electrolyte transport in the 
airways and kidneys, and the role of CFTR, SLC26A9, and the anoctamins 
ANO1 and ANO6. Emphasis was placed on cystic fibrosis and 
asthma, as well as renal alkalosis and polycystic kidney disease. They summarize evidence indicating that CFTR is the 
only relevant secretory Cl- channel in airways under basal 
(nonstimulated) conditions and after stimulation by secretagogues. The expressions of ANO1 and ANO6 are 
important for the correct expression and function of CFTR. The Cl- transporter, SLC26A9, expressed in the airways, may have a reabsorptive rather than a Cl--secretory function. In the renal collecting ducts, bicarbonate secretion occurs through the synergistic action of CFTR and the Cl-/HCO3- transporter SLC26A4 (pendrin; TC# 2.A.53.2.17), which is probably supported by ANO1. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the 
secretory function of CFTR in renal cyst formation may have been 
overestimated, whereas ANO1 and ANO6 have been shown to be crucial 
in ADPKD and therefore represent new pharmacological targets for the 
treatment of polycystic kidney disease (Kunzelmann et al. 2023).  AlphaMissense pathogenicity predictions have been made against cystic fibrosis variants (McDonald et al. 2024). The selectivity filter is accessible from the cytosol through a large inner 
vestibule and opens to the extracellular solvent through a narrow 
portal. The identification of a chloride-binding site at the intra- and 
extracellular bridging point leads to a complete conductance 
path that permits dehydrated chloride ions to traverse the lipid 
bilayer (Levring and Chen 2024). The structural basis for CFTR inhibition by CFTRinh-172 has been presented (Young et al. 2024). Fat malabsorption in cystic fibrosis pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis in the gastrointestinal tract may play a role in disease symptoms (McDonald et al. 2024)."	Animals
3.A.1.202.2	"CFTR, an epithelial ion channel, plays a role in the regulation of epithelial ion and water transport 
and fluid homeostasis (Bagnat et al. 2010; Navis et al. 2013; Navis and Bagnat 2015). It mediates the transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane. Channel activity is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The ion 
channel is also permeable to HCO3-; selectivity depends on 
the extracellular chloride concentration. CFTR exerts its function in part by 
modulating the activity of other ion channels and transporters, and it contributes to the regulation of the pH and the ion content of the 
epithelial fluid layer. It is required for normal fluid 
homeostasis in the gut (Bagnat et al. 2010) and for normal volume expansion of Kupffer's vesicle during 
embryonic development as well as for normal establishment of left-right body 
patterning (Navis et al. 2013; Roxo-Rosa et al. 2015). It is also required for normal resistance to infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Phennicie et al. 2010)."	CFTR of Danio rerio (Zebrafish) (Brachydanio rerio)

It interacts with PEX19.  abcd3-knockout mice accumulate bile acid precursors suggesting that Abcd3 imports these compounds as CoA derivatives into peroxisomes (Visser et al. 2007).  These mutants also accumulate pristanic acid suggesting that Abcd3 also imports branched chain substrates into peroxisomes (Sakamoto et al. 2019). The unfolded protein response (UPR) detects and restores deficits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding capacity (Torres et al. 2019). Ceapins are aromatic compounds that specifically inhibit the UPR sensor ATF6alpha, an ER-tethered transcription factor, by retaining it at the ER. Ceapin's function is dependent on ABCD3. ABCD3 physically associates with ER-resident ATF6alpha in cells and in vitro in a Ceapin-dependent manner. Ceapins induce the neomorphic association of ER and peroxisomes by directly tethering the cytosolic domain of ATF6alpha to ABCD3's transmembrane regions without inhibiting or depending on ABCD3 transport activity (Torres et al. 2019).  Ceapins act through ABCD3 which binds to ATF6α. causing the ER to be tethered to the peroxysome, preventing ATF6α from carrying out its function as the unfolded protein response sensor (Torres et al. 2019)."

symbiotic nodule cells which house the bacteroids. NCR peptides are 
related to antimicrobial peptides of innate immunity, but they induce the 
endosymbionts into a differentiated, enlarged, and polyploid state (Guefrachi et al. 2015). BclA is required for the formation of differentiated and functional 
bacteroids in the nodules of the NCR peptide-producing Aeschynomene legumes. BclA catalyzes import of NCR peptides 
and provides protection against the antimicrobial activity of these 
peptides. Moreover, BclA can complement the role of the related BacA transporter of Sinorhizobium meliloti, which has a similar symbiotic function in the interaction with Medicago legumes (Guefrachi et al. 2015)."	BclA of Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS 285

3.A.1.203.15	ABCD1 transporter of 766 aas and 6 TMSs. Similar to human patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), zebrafish abcd1 mutants have elevated very long chain fatty acid levels, and CNS development was disrupted, with hypomyelination in the spinal cord, abnormal patterning, decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and impaired motor function followed by increased cell death (Strachan et al. 2017). Expression of human ABCD1 in zebrafish oligodendrocytes rescued apoptosis in the abcd1 mutant (Strachan et al. 2017).	ABCD1 of Danio rerio (Zebrafish) (Brachydanio rerio)
3.A.1.203.3	"The peroxysomal long chain fatty acid (LCFA) half transporter, ABCD1 (ALD, ALDP, the X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD or ALDP) protein) (functions as a homodimer and accepts acyl-CoA esters (van Roermund et al. 2008)). It transports C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids and their CoA-derivatives as substrates (van Roermund et al., 2011; Jia et al. 2022).  ABCD1 deficiency or mutation is associated with plasma and tissue elevation of C24:0 and C26:0 accompanied by demyelination and inflamation (Baarine et al. 2012).  X-ALD is a recessive neurodegenerative disorder that
affects the brain's white matter and is associated with adrenal insufficiency. It is characterized
by abnormal function of peroxisomes, which leads to an accumulation of very long-chain fatty
acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues, especially in the cortex of the adrenal glands and the white
matter of the central nervous system, causing demyelinating disease and adrenocortical insufficiency
(Addison's disease or X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (Kallabi et al. 2013; Andreoletti et al. 2017) The system forms heterodimers with PMP70 (ABCD3; TC#3.A.1.203.1) (Hillebrand et al. 2007). X-ALD, the most common peroxisomal disorder, results from mutations in ABCD1 (ALDP) (Margoni et al. 2017). The structure and function of the ABCD1 variant database have been described (Mallack et al. 2022). This peroxisomal very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) transporter is central to fatty acid catabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Its dysfunction underlies toxic cytosolic accumulation of VLCFAs, progressive demyelination, and neurological impairment including X-ALD. Le et al. 2022 presented cryo-EM structures of ABCD1 in phospholipid nanodiscs in a nucleotide bound conformation open to the peroxisomal lumen and an inward facing conformation open to the cytosol at up to 3.5 Å resolution, revealing details of its transmembrane cavity and ATP- dependent conformational spectrum. They identified features distinguishing ABCD1 from its closest homologs and showed that coenzyme A (CoA) esters of VLCFAs modulate ABCD1 activity in a species dependent manner. A transport mechanism was suggested in which the CoA moieties of VLCFA-CoAs enter the hydrophilic transmembrane domain while the acyl chains extend out into the surrounding membrane bilayer. The structures help rationalize disease causing mutations (Le et al. 2022). Three cryogenic EM structures of ABCD1: the apo-form, substrate- and ATP-bound forms have been solved (Chen et al. 2022). Distinct from what was seen in the previously reported ABC transporters, the two symmetric molecules of behenoyl coenzyme A (C22:0-CoA) cooperatively bind to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). For each C22:0-CoA, the hydrophilic 3'-phospho-ADP moiety of the CoA portion inserts into one TMD, with the succeeding pantothenate and cysteamine moiety crossing the inter-domain cavity, whereas the hydrophobic fatty acyl chain extends to the opposite TMD. Structural analysis combined with biochemical assays illustrated snapshots of the ABCD1-mediated substrate transport cycle (Chen et al. 2022). Jia et al. 2022 reported the cryo-EM structure of human ALDP at 3.4 Å resolution. ALDP exhibits a cytosolic-facing conformation. Compared to other lipid ATP-binding cassette transporters, ALDP has two substrate binding cavities formed within the transmembrane domains. Such structural organization may be suitable for the coordination of VLCFAs. X-ALD is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, encoding a peroxisomal protein, which has various clinical manifestations and a rapid progression from initial symptoms to fatal inflammatory demyelination (Yu et al. 2022). Structural insights into substrate recognition and translocation of human peroxisomal ABC transporter, ALDP, have appeared (Xiong et al. 2023)."	Animals

The peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA transporter, Comatose (CTS, ABCD1, ABCD1, ABCC1, PED3, Pxa1; 1337aas) (Nyathi et al., 2010) determines germination potential and fertility and is essential for acetate metabolism (Linka and Esser 2012).  It associates with long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (LACS6 (Q8LPS1) and LACS7 (Q8LKS5) and has intrinsic acyl CoA thiesterase activity (De Marcos Lousa et al. 2013). It has been proposed that it transports and hydrolyzes acyl-CoA esters, releasing a non-esterified fatty acid into the peroxisomal matrix which then needs to be re-activated by peroxisomal LACS6 or LACS7 (Visser et al. 2007). Mutagenesis of three residues in TMS 9 differentially affected the ATPase and thioesterase activities (Carrier et al. 2019).	Plants

They are of 870 and 853 aas, respectively, both probably with 6 TMSs in a 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 TMS arrangement. Oxidation of its substrates requires the peroxysomal fatty acyl CoA ligase, suggesting that the free acids are the transported substrates.	Yeast
3.A.1.203.7	Peroxisomal fatty acid transporter, ABCD2, ALD1, ALDL1, ALDR, or ALDRP.

The loss of AbcD2 results in greater oxidative stress in murine adrenal cells than the loss of abcd1 (Lu et al. 2007). Based on the 2.85 Å resolution crystal structure of the mitochondrial ABC transporter, ABCB10, Andreoletti et al. 2017 proposed structural models for all three peroxisomal ABCD proteins.

3.A.1.204.2	"Drug resistance transporter, ABCG2 (MXR; ABCP; BCRP) (human breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP) (Moitra et al., 2011). It exports urate and haem in haempoietic cells (Latunde-Dada et al., 2006) as well as cytotoxic agents (mitoxantrone, flavopiridol, methotrexate, 7-hydroxymethotrexate, methotrexate diglutamate, topotecan, rosurvastatin, and resveratrol), fluorescent dyes (Hoechst 33342) and other toxic substances (PhIP and pheophorbide a) (Özvegy-Laczka et al., 2005; Nigam 2015). It also transports folate and sterols: estradiol, and probably cholesterol, progesterone, testosterone and tamoxifen (Janvilisri et al., 2003; Breedveld et al., 2007).  It is a homotetramer (Xu et al., 2004).  It forms a homodimer bound via a disulfide bond at Cys-603 which stabilizes the protein against ubiquitin-mediated degradation in proteosomes (Wakabayashi et al., 2007), and can for dodecamers with 12 subunits (Xu et al. 2007). It has 6 established TMSs with the N- and C- termini inside (Wang et al., 2008). The following drugs are exported from human breast cancer cell line MCF-7: miloxantrone, daunorubicin, doxorubicin and rhodamine123).  Also transports reduced folates and mono-, di- and tri-glutamate derivatives of folic acid and methotrexate (Assaraf et al., 2006). It is an active glutathione efflux pump (Brechbuhl et al., 2010). Mutations in ABCG2 cause hyperuricemia and gout , which led to the identification of urate as a physiological subsrate for ABCG2; it catalyzes elimination of urate across the renal tubular apical membrane (Prestin et al. 2014). Zafirlukast antagonizes ABCG2 multidrug resistance (Sun et al., 2012). Inhibited by Sildenafil (Shi et al., 2011) and lapatinib derivatives (Sodani et al., 2012).  Mutation of basic residues can increase or decrease drug efflux activities (Cai et al. 2010).  A substrate of ABCG2 is d-luciferin, allowing bioluminescent immaging of drug efflux across the blood-brain barrier.  Inhibitors include Ko143, gefetinib and nilotinib (Bakhsheshian et al. 2013).  Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013).  Telabinib reverses chemotheraputic MDR mediated by ABCG2 (Sodani et al. 2014).  Residues involved in protein trafficking and drug transport activity have been identified (Haider et al. 2015).  The 3-d structure in the inward facing conformation has been solved (Rosenberg et al. 2015). Durmus et al. 2015 and Westover and Li 2015 have reviewed BCRP-mediated transport of cancer chemotheraputic agents.  A role for the C2-sequence of the ABCG2
linker region in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis coupled to drug efflux has been proposed (Macalou et al. 2015).  Functions at the blood:placenta barrier of the mouse (Kumar et al. 2016). The Q141K variant exhibits
decreased functional expression and thus increased drug accumulation and decreased urate secretion, and the R482 position, which plays
a role the substrate specificity, is located in one of the substrate binding
pockets (László et al. 2016). Naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms in humans giving rise to amino acyl residue substitutions in the transmembrane domains result in impared transport of Lucifer Yellow and estrone sulfate (Sjöstedt et al. 2017). A cryoEM structure revealed two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between TMSs. A multidrug recognition and transport mechanism was proposed, and disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms were  rationalized. The structural basis of cholesterol recognition by G-subfamily ABC transporters was also revealed (Taylor et al. 2017). Catalyzes efflux of ochratoxin A (OTA) (Qi et al. 2017). Penylheteroaryl-phenylamide scaffold allows ABCG2 inhibition. 4-Methoxy-N-(2-(2-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)benzamide (43) exhibited a highest potency (IC50=61nM)), selectivity, low intrinsic toxicity, and it reversed the ABCG2-mediated drug resistance at 0.1muM (Köhler et al. 2018). ABCG2 acts in concert with ABCA1, ABCB1 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-β 
peptide (Aβ) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018).  Inhibited by dacomitinib (Fan et al. 2018). A specific inhibitor, CCTA-1523, is a potent, selective and reversible modulator of ABCG2 (Patel et al. 2017). Exports uric acid (urate), and its loss promotes  onset of hyperuricemia.  It has potential as a regulator of Gout (Fujita and Ichida 2018). High resolution cryo-EM structures of human ABCG2 bound to synthetic derivatives of the fumitremorgin C-related inhibitor Ko143 or the multidrug resistance modulator tariquidar have been solved (Jackson et al. 2018). Both compounds are bound to the central, inward-facing cavity of ABCG2, blocking access for substrates and preventing conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The high resolutions allowed for de novo building of the entire transporter and also revealed tightly bound phospholipids and cholesterol interacting with the lipid-exposed surface of the TMSs (Jackson et al. 2018). Multiple drug binding pockets and residues involved in binding have been identified (Cox et al. 2018). The third transmembrane helix and adjacent regions of ABCG2 may interact with AT1 receptor antagonists, giving rise to drug-drug interactions in multi-drug regimens (Ripperger et al. 2018). The system is inhibitied by hetero aryl phenyl inhititors (Köhler et al. 2018). It is present in the blood-brain, blood-testis and maternal-fetal barriers, and cryoEM of a mutant shows the protein in a substrate-bound pre-translocation state and an ATP-bound post-translocation state (Manolaridis et al. 2018). A single molecule of estrone-3-sulfate (E1S) is bound in a central, hydrophobic, cytoplasm-facing cavity about halfway across the membrane. Only one molecule of E1S can bind in the observed binding mode. In the ATP-bound state, the substrate-binding cavity has collapsed while an external cavity has opened to the extracellular side of the membrane. The ATP-induced conformational changes include rigid-body shifts of the transmembrane domains, pivoting of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a change in the relative orientation of the NBD subdomains (Manolaridis et al. 2018). This shows how the energy of ATP binding extrudes E1S and other substrates, and suggests that the size and binding affinity of compounds are important for distinguishing substrates from inhibitors. Its structure, mechanism and inhibitory propensity have been reviewed (Kapoor et al. 2018). Y6, an Epigallocatechin Gallate Derivative, Reverses ABCG2-Mediated Mitoxantrone Resistance (Zhao et al. 2018). ABCG2 confers resistance to several cancer treatments. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anti-cancer method involving the use of light-activated photosensitisers to induce oxidative stress and cell death in cancers, but ABCG2 can efflux photosensitisers (Khot et al. 2019). Regorafenib sensitized MDR colon cancer cells to BCRP substrates by increasing  intracellular accumulation without changes in the expression level or the subcellular distribution of BCRP in the cells exposed to regorafenib. Regorafenib stimulates BCRP ATPase activity and promotes a stable interaction between regorafenib and the transmembrane domain of BCRP (Zhang et al. 2019). Several potent inhibitors, effective in the millimicromolar range have been identified (Zou et al. 2020). Licochalcone A selectively resensitizes ABCG2-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (Wu et al. 2020). The GXXXG motif promotes proper packing of the TMSs in the functional ABCG2 homodimer (Polgar et al. 2004). Molecular dynamics simulations have provided insight into the steps of the substrate transport process and its regulation by cholesterol (Nagy et al. 2020). Drug binding cavities other than the central binding site as well as a putative dynamic transport pathway for substrates with variable structures have been revealed. Membrane cholesterol accelerated drug transport by promoting the closure of cytoplasmic protein regions. ABCG2 is present in all major biological barriers and drug-metabolizing organs, influences the pharmacokinetics of numerous clinically applied drugs, and plays a key role in uric acid extrusion (Nagy et al. 2020). The first intracellular loop is essential for the catalytic cycle (Khunweeraphong and Kuchler 2020). While all other human ABCG transporters are specific for lipids, ABCG2 has a network of residues that may confer extra conformational flexibility, enabling it to transport a wider array of substrates (Mitchell-White et al. 2021). VKNG-1, an inhibitor of ABCG2, may, in combination with certain anticancer drugs, provide a treatment to overcome ABCG2-mediated MDR colon cancers (Narayanan et al. 2021). Sophoraflavanone (SFG) may be  an effective inhibitor of ABCG2 to improve the efficacy of therapeutic drugs in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Wu et al. 2021). It transports estrone 3-sulfate and many drugs (Dudas et al. 2022). ZIn both domestic and nondomestic cats (felids) have mutationally alterred ABCG2 proteins and consequently experience fluoroquinolone-induced retinal phototoxicity (Gochenauer et al. 2022). The multifunctionality of ABCG2 has been established, and details of the potential therapeutic role of ABCG2 in pan-cancer has been considered (Lyu et al. 2022). ABCB6, ABCG2, FECH and CPOX are expressed in meningioma tissue (Spille et al. 2023). ABCG2 limits the efficacy of transcriptional CDK inhibitors, and multiple kinase inhibitors disrupt ABCG2 transport 
function, thereby synergizing with CDK inhibitors (van der Noord et al. 2023). The efflux of anti-psychotics through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via this system has been demonstrated (Nasyrova et al. 2023). The structural basis of the allosteric inhibition of human ABCG2 by nanobodies has been determined (Irobalieva et al. 2023).  Imperatorin restores chemosensitivity of multidrug-resistant cancer cells by antagonizing ABCG2-mediated drug transport (Wu et al. 2023).  ABCG2 may be a molecular target for acute myeloid leukemia (Damiani and Tiribelli 2024)."

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi facilitate plant uptake of mineral nutrients and obtain organic nutrients such as sugars and fatty acids, from the plant, and this ABCG transporter is required to form the symbiosis.

Strigolactones promote the localisation of the
 ABA exporter ABCG25 at the plasma membrane in root epidermal cells of 
Arabidopsis thaliana (Russo et al. 2023).  Thus, a mechanism for ABA homeostasis regulation is proposed in the context of 
osmotic stress acclimation: the fine tuning by strigolactones of ABCG25 
localisation in root cells (Russo et al. 2023).  The cryo-EM structure and molecular mechanism used by the abscisic acid transporter, ABCG25, which regulates stomatal closure, seed germination and development, has been described (Huang et al. 2023). It was solved in an inward-facing apo conformation, an ABA-bound pre-translocation conformation and an outward-facing occluded conformation. A 'gate-flipper' translocation model was proposed (Huang et al. 2023).

3.A.1.204.5	"The ABCG5 (sterolin-1)/ABCG8 (sterolin-2) heterodimeric neutral sterol (cholesterol and plant sterols) (e.g., sitosterol and lutein) (phosphoryl donors ATP > CTP > GTP > UTP) exporter; present in the apical membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes ((Reboul 2013). Cholesteryl oleate, phosphatidyl choline and enantiomeric cholesterol are poorly transported (mutation of either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause sitosterolemia and coronary atherosclerosis) (Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006; 2011). It is involved in cell signalling, creation of membrane asymmetry and apoptosis (Quazi and Molday, 2011). The ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer (G5G8) mediates excretion of neutral sterols as well as the drug, Marinobufagenin, a Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, in the liver and
intestine (Lan et al. 2018). Mutations disrupting G5G8 cause sitosterolaemia, a disorder characterized by sterol
accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. Lee et al. 2016 used crystallization in lipid bilayers to
determine the X-ray structure in a nucleotide-free state at 3.9 Å resolution. The structure revealed a new
transmembrane fold that is present in a large and functionally diverse superfamily of ABC
transporters. The transmembrane domains are coupled to the nucleotide-binding sites by networks of
interactions that differ between the active and inactive ATPases, reflecting the catalytic asymmetry
of the transporter (Lee et al. 2016). High expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were observed in liver, the digestive tract and the mammary gland. The system plays roles in lipid and sterol intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and lipid trafficking and excretion during lactation (Viturro et al. 2006). ABCG5/G8 is active in the excretion of cholesterol and sterols into bile (vanBerge-Henegouwen et al. 2004). Disruption of the unique ABCG-family NBD:NBD interface impacts both drug transport and ATP hydrolysis (Kapoor et al. 2020). Transmembrane polar relay drives the allosteric regulation for the ABCG5/G8 sterol transporter (Xavier et al. 2020). Rare mutations can give rise to tendon xanthoma along with tendosynovitis (Wadsack et al. 2018). ABCG5/8 mediates secretion of neutral sterols into bile and the gut lumen, whereas G1 (TC# 3.A.1.204.12) transports cholesterol from macrophages to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Cryo-EM structures of human G5G8 in sterol-bound and human G1 in cholesterol- and ATP-bound states have been solved. Both transporters have a sterol-binding site that is accessible from the cytosolic leaflet. A second site is present midway through the transmembrane domains of ABCG5/G8. The Walker A motif of G8 adopts a unique conformation that accounts for the marked asymmetry in ATPase activities between the two nucleotide-binding sites of G5G8 (Sun et al. 2021). Residues have been mapped to the structural cores of TMSs), the NBD-TMD interface, and the interface between TMDs. They serve as sequence signatures to differentiate ABCG5/ABCG8 from other ABCG subfamily proteins, and some of them may contribute to substrate specificity of the ABCG5/ABCG8 transporter (Pei and Cong 2022). Structural analysis of cholesterol binding and sterol selectivity by ABCG5/G8 have been reported (Farhat et al. 2022). ABCG5/G8 gene region variants exert differential effects on lipid profiles, blood pressure status, and gallstone disease history (Teng et al. 2023)."	Animals

cutin and possibly wax transport to the extracellular matrix. Involved in 
developmental plasticity and stress responses (Bird et al. 2007).  ABCG11 can traffic to the plasma membrane in the absence of ABCG12 and can form flexible dimers. By contrast, ABCG12 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of ABCG11, indicating that ABCG12 can only form dimers with ABCG11 in the plasm membrane of epidermal cells.

3.A.1.205.1	"Pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR; Pdr5) exporter; steroid exporter; sporidesmin toxicity suppressor (Sts1); MDR; cyclic nucleotide exporter; amphipathic anion exporter.  Its ATPase activity is inhibited by its substrate, clotrimazole; can use ATP, GTP and maybe UTP to drive efflux (Golin et al., 2007).  Molecular modeling revealed aspects of the binding pocket and mechanism of action (Rutledge et al. 2011).  Charged residues at the end of TMS2 affect transport (Dou et al. 2016). The 23-membered-ring macrolide tacrolimus, a commonly used immunosuppressant, also known as FK506, is a broad-spectrum inhibitor and an efflux pump substrate, and mutations that minimize its export have been isolated (Tanabe et al. 2018). An A666G mutation in TMS 5 of Pdr5 increases drug efflux by enhancing cooperativity between transport sites (Arya et al. 2019). Mutations in Pdr5 give rise to altered drug specificity (Tutulan-Cunita et al. 2005). Batzelladine D and norbatzelladine L reverse the fluconazole resistance phenotype mediated by Pdr5p. Both alkaloids were able to chemosensitize the Pdr5p-overexpressing strain by synergistic interaction with fluconazole, and both compounds also showed an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity and on the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 6G, but did not show significant in vitro mammalian cells toxicity (Domingos et al. 2020). The mechanism involves a ""flippase"" step that moves the substrates from one leaflet of the bilayer to the other, as a central element of cellular efflux (Raschka et al. 2022). The gating region residues of Pdr5, and possibly other ABCG transporters,
 play a role not only in molecular gating but also in allosteric 
regulation, conformational switching, and protein folding (Alhumaidi et al. 2022). Banerjee et al. 2023 reported a comprehensive overview of the structural and functional aspects of catalytically asymmetric ABC pumps such as members of the yeast PDR subfamily."	Yeast

It responds to abiotic stresses such as heavy metals (Cd2+ and lead) and is regulated by pathogenic defense hormones (Kim et al. 2007). It probably exports a wide range of compounds including monolignols (Lefèvre and Boutry 2018) and Indole butyric acid (IBA), a precursor of indole acetic acid (IAA) (Damodaran and Strader 2019).

TruMDR3 transports voriconazole (VRC) and itraconazole (ITC), while TruMDR2 transports only ITC. Disruption of TruMDR3 abolished resistance to VRC and reduced its resistance to ITC (Monod et al. 2019).	TmrMDR3 of Trichophyton rubrum
3.A.1.205.4	"Multidrug resistance protein, Cdr1 (Candida drug resistance 1) of 1501 aas and 14 TMSs in a CMCM arrangement with each M domain having 7 TMSs in a 6 + 1 TMS arrangement. It confers resistance to cycloheximide, xenobiotics and antifungal agents such as azoles and terbinafine (Holmes et al., 2006; Schuetzer-Muehlbauer et al., 2003); also, transports phospholipids (Shukla et al., 2007). It is the major fluconazole efflux system in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans (Holmes et al., 2008; Basso et al., 2010). Substitution of threonine-1351 results in hypersusceptibility to antifungal agents and threonine-1351 is essential for synergic effects of calcineurin inhibitor FK520 (Shukla et al. 2004). It is similar to Cdr2. For additional details of both systems, as well as other MDR pumps in various Candida species, see Cannon et al., 1998. Chimeras between Cdr1 and Cdr2 revealed regions determining substrate specificity (Tanabe et al., 2011).  The protein has a large polyspecific drug-binding pocket formed by many of the TMSs (Rawal et al. 2013).  The macrocyclic polyketide, FK520, an analologue of antifungal FK506, and a potent immunosuppressant that prevents T-cell proliferation, displays fungicidal synergism with azoles in Candida albicans and inhibits drug efflux mediated by ABC multidrug transporters including Cdr (Nim et al. 2014).  TMS 5 residues impart substrate specificity and
selectively act as a communication link between ATP hydrolysis and drug transport (Puri et al. 2009).  The 4 domains (2Cs and 2 Ms) are connected by intracellular loops that allow coupling between ATP hydrolysis and transport  (Shah et al. 2015) and faciliitate membrane targetting (Shah et al. 2015). Multiple drug binding sites have been identified (Nim et al. 2016). The system also transports steroid hormones such as β-estradiol and corticosterone as well as rhodamine 6G using specific but overlapping binding sites (Baghel et al. 2017).  The 23-membered-ring macrolide, tacrolimus, a commonly used 
immunosuppressant also known as FK506, is a broad-spectrum inhibitor

have been isolated (Tanabe et al. 2018). A structural motif, called the E-helix, plays a role in the maintenance of proper structural fold and/or inter-domain contacts (Vishwakarma et al. 2019). A Q1005H mutant displayed two-fold reduced ATPase activity and two-fold increased drug-resistance as compared to the wild-type protein, pointing to direct control of the non-hydrolytic NBS in substrate-translocation through ATP binding in asymmetric ABC pumps (Banerjee et al. 2019). A functional Cys-deficient Cdr1 protein has been designed (Madani et al. 2021). Milbemycins, enniatin B, beauvericin and FK506 are broad-spectrum fungal multidrug efflux pump inhibitors that inhibit Cdr1, and inhibitor resistant mutants have alterred substrate specificity (Niimi et al. 2021)."

3.A.1.208.1	Multi-drug resistance-associated protein, MRP1-like protein (MLP1 or MRP1) (Exporter of leukotrienes, glutathione and cysteinyl conjugates of organic anions, drugs, unmodified hydrophobic xenobiotics and hydrophilic conjugated endobiotics). Vincristine and glutathione are co-transported. MRP1 catalyzes export of glutathione during apoptosis (Hammond et al., 2007). Also transports reduced folates as well as mono-, di- and tri-glutamate derivatives of folic acid and methotrexate (Assaraf et al., 2006). The ABCC subgoup of ABC exporters consists of 13 members in mammals, ABCC1 to 13, and their expression levels correlate either positively or negatively (depeding on the system) with gastric cancer (Mao et al. 2019). The ABCC subfamily may be involved in the transmembrane transport of organic selenium (Se) (Li et al. 2023). Suppression of MRP1 activity by coumarin derivatives has been documented (Shahpouri et al. 2023).	Animals
3.A.1.208.10	"Multidrug (anthracycline) resistance organic anion efflux pump (ABCC6; ABC-C6; MRP6; MOAT-E) - the ectopic mineralization disorder, pseudoxanthoma elasticum disease (PXE), protein (Vanakker et al. 2013; Rasmussen et al. 2013). It exports glutathione metal conjugates as well as leukotriene C4, DNP, and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione, and also exports anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, cisplatin, and probably probenecid, benzbromarone and indomethacin (Chen and Tiwari, 2011).  The system participates in networds of complex diseases (De Vilder et al. 2015). This transporter has an extra N-terminal domain (TMD0) and a loop, L0.  TMD0 is not required for transport function, but L0 maintains ABCC6 in a
targeting-competent state for the basolateral membranes of liver and kidney cells and might be involved in regulating the NBDs (Miglionico et al. 2016). PXE is a disease of altered
elastic properties in multiple tissues. Many of these mutations influence various steps in the
biosynthetic pathway, minimally altering local domain structure but adversely impacting ABCC6
assembly and trafficking (Ran and Thibodeau 2016). PXE is an ectopic, metabolic mineralization disorder that affects the skin, eye, and vessels. ABCC6 is assumed to mediate efflux of one or several small molecule compounds from the liver cytosol to the circulation. In mice, abrogating ABCC6 function causes alterations in the liver metabolic profile, suggesting that PXE is a metabolic disease originating from a liver disturbance (Rasmussen et al. 2016). Thus, MRP6 is involved in the regulation of tissue calcification in mammals, and mutations are associated with human ectopic calcification disorders. Comparative analyses of ABCC6 and ABCC1 from invertebrates to vertebrates revealed a bony endoskeleton first evolved with ABCC1, while the ABCC6 gene is only found in bony vertebrate genomes (Parreira et al. 2018). Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable multi-system ectopic mineralization disorder, is caused by inactivating mutations in the ABCC6 gene. The encoded protein has a specialized efflux function in hepatocytes by contributing to plasma levels of PPi, a potent inhibitor of mineralization in soft connective tissues. Reduced plasma PPi levels underlie the ectopic mineralization in PXE (Kowal et al. 2021).  AbcC6 deficiency prevents rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (Casemayou et al. 2023)."	Animals
3.A.1.208.11	"Vacuolar metal resistance and drug detoxification protein, yeast cadmium factor (YCF1 or Ycf1p), of 1515 aas and 15 or 16 TMSs in a 5 + 6 + 4 or 5 TMS arrangement; it transports cadmium-glutathione conjugates, glutathione S-conjugated leukotriene C4, organic glutathione S-conjugates, selenodigluthatione, unconjugated bilirubin, reduced glutathione, and diazaborine (Lazard et al., 2011). It mediates arsenite expulsion, possibly as a glutathione conjugate. Activity is dependent on Tus1p, a guanine nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rho1p and a Rho1p-dependent-positive regulator of Ycf1p (Paumi et al. 2007). The structure of Ycf1p reveals the transmembrane domain TMD0 and the regulatory region of ABCC transporters (Bickers et al. 2021)."	Yeast

Human earwax consists of wet and dry types. Dry earwax is frequent in East Asians, whereas wet earwax is common in other populations. A SNP, 538G --> A (rs17822931), in the ABCC11 gene is responsible for determination of earwax type. Cells with allele A show a lower excretory activity for cGMP than those with allele G. The 538G --> A SNP is the first example of DNA polymorphism determining a visible genetic trait (Yoshiura et al., 2006).  Binding sites in ABCC11 for cGMP (cyclic guanosine
monophosphate) and 5FdUMP (5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate), the active metabolite of the
anticancer drug 5-fluoro-uracil, have been identified (Honorat et al. 2013).  MRP8 generally exports a variety of anionic lipophilic compounds including antiviral and anticancer agents (Arlanov et al. 2015). Inhibition of cAMP efflux can stimulate leukemia cell differentiation, cell growth arrest, and apoptosis (Perez et al. 2020)."	Animals

It also transports reduced folates as well as mono-, di- and tri-glutamate derivatives of folic acid and methotrexate (Assaraf et al., 2006).  When overexpressed, it can lower the intracellular concentration of nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, such as the antiviral compounds PMEA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine) or ganciclovir, and of anticancer nucleobase analogues, such as 6-mercaptopurine, after their conversion into the respective nucleotides (Ritter et al., 2005).

3.A.1.208.23	"The Sur2B (ABCC9) sulfonylurea receptor. The amino-terminal transmembrane domain of Sur2B binds Kir6.2 (Winkler et al., 2011). Dominant missense mutations in ABCC9, promoting open channel formation, cause Cantú syndrome (Harakalova et al., 2012; van Bon et al., 2012). This protein is part of an ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channel that couples the metabolic state of a cell with its electrical activity.  Associated with  early repolarization (ERS) and Brugada (BrS) syndromes (Hu et al. 2014).  This ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel couples glucose metabolism to insulin secretion in
pancreatic beta-cells (de Wet et al. 2007). The vasodilator binding sites on the SUR2 subunit have been identified (Ding et al. 2022). Cryo-EM structures of SUR2A and SUR2B subunits in complex with Mg-nucleotides and P1075 or levcromakalim, two chemically distinct KATP openers that are specific to SUR2, have been determined. Both P1075 and levcromakalim bind to a common site in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the SUR2 subunit, which is between TMD1 and TMD2 and is embraced by TMSs 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17.

3.A.1.208.31	"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7, MRP7 or ABCC10 of 1492 aas.  Probably involved in cellular detoxification through lipophilic anion extrusion.  Isoform 1 is specifically expressed in spleen; isoform 2 is more widely expressed. The combination of ibrutinib and paclitaxel can effectively antagonize ABCB1- and ABCC10-mediated paclitaxel resistance (Zhang et al. 2017). It may function in regulating immune cell infiltration patterns along with four other ABC transporters (ABCA8, ABCA12, ABCB6 and ABCB8) (Wang et al. 2022). In addition to sphingomyelin and ceramide, sugar derivatives of ceramides, hexosylceramides (HexCer), are the major circulating sphingolipids. ABCC10 partakes in modulating the synthesis and subsequent efflux of hexosyl ceramides (HexCer) to HDL in liver cells (Iqbal et al. 2022). Activities of lysosomal ABCC3, ABCC5 and ABCC10 are responsible for 
lysosomal sequestration of doxorubicin and paclitaxel-oregongreen488 in 
paclitaxel-resistant cancer cell lines (Gronkowska et al. 2023). ABCC10/MRP7 consists of three transmembrane domains and two nucleotide 
binding domains. It mediates multidrug resistance of tumor cells to a 
variety of anticancer drugs by increasing drug efflux and results in 
reducing intracellular drug accumulation (Chen et al. 2024). The transport substrates of 
ABCC10/MRP7 include antineoplastic drugs such as taxanes, vinca 
alkaloids, and epothilone B, as well as endobiotics such as leukotriene 
C4 (LTC4) and estradiol 17 β-D-glucuronide. A variety of 
ABCC10/MRP7 inhibitors, including cepharanthine, imatinib, erlotinib, 
tariquidar, and sildenafil, can reverse ABCC10/MRP7-mediated MDR. 
Additionally, the presence or absence of ABCC10/MRP7 is also closely

Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) cause neonatal diabetes mellitus. Because mutant channels are inhibited less strongly by MgATP, this increases K(ATP) currents in pancreatic beta cells, thus reducing insulin secretion and producing diabetes (de Wet et al., 2007). Binds ligands (blockers): glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and meglitinide as well as agonists, SR47063 (a cromakalim analog), P1075 (a pinacidil analog), and diazoxide (Bessadok et al., 2011). ATP activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels composed of mutant sulfonylurea receptor 1 and Kir6.2 with diminished PIP2 sensitivity (Pratt and Shyng, 2011). Dominant missense mutations in ABCC9, promoting open channel formation, cause Cantú syndrome (Harakalova et al., 2012; van Bon et al., 2012). The N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1 controls gating of Kir6.2 by modulating channel sensitivity to PIP2 (Pratt et al., 2011). Familial mild hyperglycemia is due to the ABCC8-V84I mutation (Gonsorcikova et al., 2011). ATP regulates KATP channels by promoting dimerization and conformational switching (Ortiz et al. 2013).  Mutations causing neonatal diabetes are attributed to alterations in the affinites for ATP and ADP (Ortiz and Bryan 2015).  Two groups of mutations with different cellular mechanisms have been identified. 1) Channel complexes with mutations in NBD2 of SUR1 traffic normally but are unable
to be activated by MgADP. 2) Channel mutations in the TMS domains of SUR1 are retained in
the ER and have variable functional impairment (Nessa et al. 2015). KATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR1) in the brain and endocrine
pancreas  couple metabolic status to the membrane potential. In 
beta-cells, increases in
cytosolic [ATP/ADP] inhibit KATP channel activity, leading to membrane 
depolarization and
exocytosis of insulin granules. Mutations in ABCC8 (SUR1) or KCNJ11 
(Kir6.2) can result in gain or
loss of channel activity and cause neonatal diabetes (ND) or congenital 
hyperinsulinism (CHI),
respectively.  Nucleotide binding without hydrolysis switches SUR1 to 
stimulatory conformations.  Increased affinity for ATP gives rise to ND 
while decreased affinty gives rise to CHI (Ortiz and Bryan 2015). SUR1 mutations constitute a genetic aetiology for neonatal diabetes, and they act by reducing the KATP channel's ATP sensitivity (Proks et al. 2006). Polymorphic ABCC8 isoforms are key regulatory proteins of cerebral oedema in many neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (Jha et al. 2018). In polymorphisms predictive of oedema, variant alleles/genotypes confer increased risk while different variant polymorphisms are associated with favourable outcome, potentially suggesting distinct mechanisms (Jha et al. 2018). KATP channels are energy sensors that are clinically validated drug targets. KATP inhibitors are prescribed for diabetes and KATP activators are used for the treatment of hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hair loss. Wu et al., 2022 [PMID 36253099] highlight the current knowledge about the drug binding modes observed using cryogenic EM. The inhibitors and activators bind to two distinct sites in the transmembrane domain of the SUR subunit. These drugs allosterically modulate the dimerization of SUR nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and thus KATP channel activity (Wu et al., 2022 [PMID 36253099])."	Animals

3.A.1.208.48	Multidrug resistance protein, MRP4 or ABCC4, of 1349 aas and 12 TMSs in an M-C-M-C domain order. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, known to cause hyperuricemia and concomitant visceral gout in Gyps vultures may be a result of interference with renal uric acid excretion. Three species of Gyps vultures are on the verge of extinction due to nephrotoxic veterinary diclofenac having entered the food chain, and because the toxicity of different avian species to the NSAIDs like diclofenac varies. MRP4, an organic anion transporter in birds, plays a unique role in unidirectional efflux of urate into the proximal renal tubular lumen for excretion and maintenance of homeostasis. Barik et al. 2019 characterized the MRP4 channel at the molecular level to predict its structural based ligand binding properties in Gallus domesticus (Indian domestic chicken) and Gyps himalayensis (the Himalayan griffon vulture)including point and insertional mutational variants.

CG4562 is mainly expressed in the gastric caeca and the anterior part of the midgut, suggesting this is the major site of heme absorption. It thus appears that CG4562 is the functional counterpart of mammalian MRP5 (Wang et al. 2022).	CG4562; MRP5; DmeI of Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly)

Apocarotenoids are carotenoid derivatives produced by the nonenzymatic or enzymatic cleavage of carotenoids, followed by different enzymatic modifications. In plants, apocarotenoids play various roles, such as attraction of pollinators and seeds dispersal, defense against pathogens and herbivores, protection against photo-oxidative stresses, stimulation and inhibition of plant growth and regulation of biological processes in the case of phytohormones abscisic acid and strigolactones. While carotenoids are in general plastid-localized metabolites, apocarotenoids can reach different final destinations inside or outside the cell (Demurtas et al. 2020).	ABCC4 of Dendrobium catenatum

3.A.1.208.7	"MRP4 (MDR4; ABCC4); exporter of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP and other nucleotide analogues, particularly purine analogues, methotrexate, bile acids, prostaglandins E1 and E2, reduced folates, 9-(2-phosphonylmethyoxyethyl)adenine, leukotrienes, estradiol 17-β-D-glucuronide) and drug sulfate conjugates (inhibited by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Reid et al., 2003; Rius et al., 2008)).  When overexpressed, it can lower the intracellular concentration of nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, such as the antiviral compounds PMEA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine), adefovir, or ganciclovir (Nigam 2015), and of anticancer nucleobase analogs, such as 6-mercaptopurine, after their conversion into the respective nucleotides.  MRP4 interacts directly with CFTR (3.A.1.202.1) to control Cl- secretion (Li et al., 2007). It also functions in urate elimination across the renal tubule apical membrane (Prestin et al. 2014).  Thus, MRP4 is a broad specificity organic anion exporter (Ritter et al., 2005). MRP4 and CFTR together function in the regulation of cAMP and beta-adrenergic contraction in cardiac myocytes (Sellers et al., 2012). Amino acid changes can alter the uptake of drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 9-(2-phosphonyl methoxyethyl) adenine
(PMEA) (Janke et al. 2008).  Positions of L1 (the linker between the two halves of the exporter), L0 (the N-terminal domain), and the zipper helices (between the two NBDs) have been suggested (Chantemargue et al. 2018). ABCC4 exports proinflammatory molecules including leukotriene, prostaglandin and sphingosine-1-phosphate across the plasma membrane. These metabolites play roles in asthma (Palikhe et al. 2017). Symmetrical 1,4-dihydropyridines are inhibitors of the MRP4 Efflux Pump and can be used for anticancer therapy (Döring et al. 2020). MRP4 contributes to platelet activation by extruding endogenous molecules responsible for their activation and accumulation and may also export various drugs (Angelis et al. 2021). Symmetrical cage compounds are inhibitors of the symmetrical MRP4-efflux pump for anticancer therapy (Kreutzer et al. 2021). The ABCC4 gene is associated with pyometra in dogs (Arendt et al. 2021) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in humans (Monte et al. 2021). Cellular uptake of and transport mechanisms for 6-mercaptopurine nanomedicines (6-MPNs) for enhanced oral bioavailability have been described (Zou et al. 2023), and MRP4 plays a significant role. ABCC4 is a prostaglandin E2 efflux transporter in the ovarian follicle and is a mediator of ovulation with a potential non-hormonal contraceptive target (Yerushalmi et al. 2023). Thus, the ABCC4 inhibitor probenecid blocks ovulation and affects key ovulatory genes in female mice in vivo.

3.A.1.208.8	"Drug resistance pump; ABCC1 (MRP1), exports chemotherapeutic agents, organic anions such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4), 17-β-estradiol 17-β-D-glucuronide, glucuronide-X (E217βG, etoposide-glucuronide), estrone-3-sulfate, folic acid and methotrexate, arsenic triglutathione, arsenic and antimonial oxyanions, glutathione (GSH), GSSG, glutathione conjugates (GSH-X; LTC4, DNP-SG, EA-SG, NEH-SG), sulfate-X (E1S, DHEAS), HIV protease inhibitors, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and Vinca alkaloids.  Changing charged residues in TMS6 (K332, H335 and D336) gave rise to specific changes in specificity (Chen et al., 2006; Haimeur et al., 2002; Leslie et al., 2004).  Also, mutations in TMS 10 alter substrate binding and export of drugs (Zhang et al. 2006). MDR1 also exports cobalamine (Vitamin B12) (Beedholm-Ebsen et al., 2010) and cytotoxic metals including antimony, mercuric ions, arsenate and arsenite, but not copper, chromium, cobalt and aluminum, often as glutathione conjugates (Aleo et al., 2005; Vernhet et al., 2000). Notch1 regulates the expression in cultured cancer cells (Cho et al., 2011).  Structural and functional properties of MRP1 have been reviewed comprehensively (He et al. 2011).  Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013).  It pumps out sulfur mustards and nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, HN2), potent vesicants developed as
chemical warfare agents (Udasin et al. 2015). It has 3 membrane domains with a total of 17 TMSs. Loss of the aromatic side chain at position 583 impairs the release of ADP and thus effectively locks the transporter in a low-affinity solute binding state (Weigl et al. 2018). MRP1 Tyr1189 and Tyr1190, unlike the corresponding residues in SUR1, are not involved in its differential sensitivity to sulfonylureas, but nevertheless, may be involved in the transport activity of MRP1, especially with respect to glutathione, GSH (Conseil et al. 2005). Modulators of MRP1 activity have been found (Möhle et al. 2020). Glu1204 serves a dual role in membrane expression of MRP1 and in a step in its catalytic cycle subsequent to initial substrate binding (Situ et al. 2004). The cotransport mechanism of GSH with anticancer drugs by MRP1 has been examined (Zhao et al. 2020). The first cytoplasmic loop in the core structure of ABCC1 contains multiple amino acids essential for Its expression (Conseil and Cole 2021). Carboplatin, paclitaxel and topotecan bind specifically to Asn510 in transmembrane domain 1 of MRP1 (Haque et al. 2022). The farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor, lonafarnib (SCH66336), is an inhibitor of multidrug resistance proteins 1 and 2, Mrp1 and Mrp2 (Wang and Johnson 2003). A macrocyclic peptide, named CPI1, inhibits MRP1 with nanomolar 
potency but shows minimal inhibition of 
P-glycoprotein. A cryo-EM structure at 3.27 Å 
resolution shows that CPI1 binds MRP1 at the same location as the 
physiological substrate leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Residues that 
interact with both ligands contain large, flexible side chains that can 
form a variety of interactions, revealing how MRP1 recognizes multiple 
structurally unrelated molecules. CPI1 binding prevents the 
conformational changes necessary for ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport (Pietz et al. 2023). ABCB1 and ABCC1 function during the TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the relationship between multidrug resistance and tumor progression has been considered (da Costa et al. 2023). The efflux of anti-psychotics through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via this system has been demonstrated (Nasyrova et al. 2023)."	Animals
3.A.1.208.9	Canicular multispecific organic anion MDR transporter, MRP3 (also called ABCC3) (most similar in sequence to MRP2).  MRP3 exports epipodophyllotoxins, etoposide and teniposide, estradiol 17-β-D-glucuronide, leukotriene C4, dinitrophenyl S-glutathione, epoposide glucuronide, methotrexate, bilirubin-glucuronides, bile acids, GSH-X (LTC4, DNP-SG) and sulfate-X (taurolithocholate-3-sulfate).  Substrate translocation and stimulated ATP hydrolysis show positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2) and are half-coupled (Seelheim et al. 2012).  ABCC3 is overexpressed in various types of cancer including carcinogenic stem cells, and plays a role in liver cancer progression (Carrasco-Torres et al. 2015). Psoraleae Fructus ethanol extracts induced hepatotoxicity by damaging mitochondria, reducing fatty acid beta-oxidation levels, and inhibiting fatty acids ingested by bile in part due to overexpression of ABCC3 (Guo et al. 2023).  Steroid hormones are substrates of the ABCC3 transporter, binding in a compatible amphiphilic substrate-binding pocket (Wang et al. 2023).  Activities of lysosomal ABCC3, ABCC5 and ABCC10 are responsible for lysosomal sequestration of doxorubicin and paclitaxel-oregongreen488 in paclitaxel-resistant cancer cell lines (Gronkowska et al. 2023).

3.A.1.209.1	"MHC heterodimeric peptide exporter (TAP) (from cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum) (TAP1=ABCB2; TAP2=ABCB3) (defects in TAP1 or TAP2 cause immunodeficiency) (TAP1/TAP2 is stabilized by tapasin isoforms 1, 2 and 3) (Raghuraman et al., 2002).  TAP1 has 10 TMSs, 4 unique N-terminal TMSs and 6 TMSs that form the translocation pore with N- and C-termini in the cytosol (Schrodt et al., 2006).  The TAP2 nucleotide binding site appears to be the main catalytic active site driving transport suggesting asymmetry in the transporter (Perria et al., 2006). The TAP complex shows strict coupling between peptide binding and ATP 
hydrolysis, revealing no basal ATPase activity in the absence of 
peptides (Herget et al., 2009).  There are three binding sites on TAP1 for tapasis which interconnects TAP and MHC class I, promotes TAP stability and facilitates heterodimerization (Leonhardt et al. 2014).  TAP is the target of GN1 (TC#8.B.25.1.1), a virally encoded protein inhibitor of viral peptide exposure on the cell surface (Verweij et al. 2008; Rufer et al. 2015). Tapasin (448 aas; O15533) stabilizes TAP2 (Papadopoulos and Momburg 2007). Tapasin is involved in the association of MHC class I 
with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and in the 
assembly of MHC class I with peptide (peptide loading). TAP plays a key role in the adaptive immune defense against infected or malignantly transformed cells by translocating proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. TAP transports peptides from 8 to 40 residues, including even branched or modified molecules, suggestive of structural flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. The bound peptides in side-chains' mobility was strongly restricted at the ends of the peptide, whereas the central region was flexible. Peptides bind to TAP in an extended kinked structure, analogous to those bound to MHC class I proteins (Herget et al., 2011).  TAP translocates proteasomal degradation products from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where these peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules by a macromolecular peptide-loading complex (PLC) and subsequently shuttled to the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a central adapter protein, tapasin (O15533) (Li et al. 2000) recruits other components of the PLC at the N-terminal domains of TAP. The alpha6/beta10-loop determines the nonsynonymous nucleotide binding of NBD1 and NBD2, whereas the switch region seems to play a critical role in regulating the functional cross-talk between the structural domains of TAP (Ehses et al. 2005). Koch et al. 2006 found that the N-terminal domains of human TAP1 and TAP2 independently bind to tapasin, thus providing two separate loading platforms for PLC assembly. Tapasin binding is dependent on the first N-terminal TMS of TAP1 and TAP2, demonstrating that these two helices contribute independently to the recruitment of tapasin and associated factors (Koch et al. 2006). The endoplasmic reticulum-resident human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein US6 (gpUS6) inhibits peptide translocation by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to prevent loading of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. gpUS6 associates with preformed TAP1/2 heterodimers (Halenius et al. 2006)."

6-mer up to at least 59-mer peptides with an optimum of 23-mers. It favors 
positively charged, aromatic and hydrophobic residues in the N- and 
C-terminal positions whereas negatively charged residues as well as 
asparagine and methionine are not favored. TapL transports a broad range of peptides of 6-60aas (23aas optimal). It has also been detected in the ER. It is stabilized by interaction with LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 (see 9.A.16) (Demirel et al., 2012).  The protein consists of a core transporter plus an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0) required to tageting to the lysosome and for interactions with LAMP-1 and -2 (Tumulka et al. 2013). TMD0 has a four transmembrane helix topology with a short helical segment in a lysosomal loop (Bock et al. 2018). Lysosomal targeting is determined by membrane localized charged residues (Graab et al. 2019).

M. tuberculosis produces two classes of siderophores, lipid-bound mycobactin and water-soluble carboxymycobactin. Iron-loaded carboxymycobactin is imported into the cytoplasm by IrtAB which has an additional cytoplasmic siderophore interaction domain that may serve as a periplasmic receptor. Membrane-reconstituted IrtAB is sufficient for the import of mycobactins, which are then reduced by the siderophore interaction domain to facilitate iron release (Arnold et al. 2020). Structure determination by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM not only confirmed that IrtAB has an ABC exporter fold (as indicated by TC-BLAST searches), but also revealed structural peculiarities at the transmembrane region of IrtAB that result in a partially collapsed inward-facing substrate-binding cavity. The siderophore interaction domain is positioned in close proximity to the inner membrane leaflet, enabling the reduction of membrane-inserted mycobactin. Enzymatic ATPase activity and in vivo growth assays revealed that IrtAB has a preference for mycobactin over carboxymycobactin as its substrate (Arnold et al. 2020). The large transporter (Rv1348-1349) of 859 aas seems to have three domains, an extracytoplasmic receptor domain (IrtA), a central membrane domain of 6 TMSs (IrtB) and a C-terminal ATPase (IrtC). If so, there may be two potential receptors (see Mandal et al. 2021 for a review). Cryo-EM structures for the M. tuberculosis iron-loaded siderophore transporter IrtAB has been reported (Sun et al. 2023). It adopts the canonical type IV exporter fold.

It exports glutathione derivatives and confers protection against heavy-metal toxicity. Fan et al. 2020 determined eight structures by X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy in distinct conformational states, stabilized by individual disulfide crosslinks and nucleotides. As NaAtm1 progresses through the transport cycle, conformational changes in TMS 6 alter the glutathione-binding site and the associated substrate-binding cavity. Kinking of TMS 6 in the post-ATP hydrolysis state, stabilized by MgADPVO4, eliminates this cavity, precluding uptake of glutathione derivatives. The presence of this cavity during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformational states, and its absence in the reverse direction, provide a mechanism for enforcing the export directionality of transport by NaAtm1 (Fan et al. 2020).

3.A.1.210.6	"Mitochondrial outer membrane/lysosome  anionic porphyrin uptake half ABC transporter, ABCB6. It is expressed in many mammalian tissues (including fetal liver) in response to intracellular porphyrin. Porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin (haem) biosynthesis (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006).  The first TMS contains a lysosomal targetting signal (Kiss et al. 2015). It transports toxic metals and anti-cancer drugs. The cryo EM structure has been determined (Wang et al. 2020). A slit-like substrate binding pocket may accommodate the planar shape of porphyrins, and the existence of a secondary cavity near the mitochondrial intermembrane space side may further facilitate substrate release. Song et al. 2021 determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc-reconstituted human ABCB6 trapped in an apo-state and an ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.6 and 3.5 Å, respectively. The structures revealed a unique loop in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of ABCB6, which divides the TMD into two cavities. It restrains the access of substrates in the inward-facing state and is removed by ATP-driven conformational changes. No ligand cavities were observed in the nucleotide-bound state, indicating a state following substrate release but prior to ATP hydrolysis. Structural analyses and functional characterization suggest an ""ATP-switch"" model and further reveal the conformational changes of the substrate-binding pockets triggered by the ATP-driven regulation (Song et al. 2021). ABCB6, ABCG2, FECH and CPOX are expressed in meningioma tissue (Spille et al. 2023)."	Animals

Atm3 is most similar to the human and yeast homologues, TC# 3.A.1.210.4 and 3.A.1.210.1, 51% and 47% identical, respectively.  It may function in cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (Bernard et al. 2009) as well as molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis (Teschner et al. 2010).  It performs an essential function in the generation of cytoplasmic 
iron-sulfur proteins by mediating export of Fe/S cluster precursors. Not required for 
mitochondrial and plastid Fe-S enzymes. Probably involved in the export

3.A.1.211.1	The cholesterol/phospholipid/leutein flippase, ABC1 (called ABCA1 in humans; Tangier disease proteins; 2261 aas and 14 TMSs in a 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 TMS arrangement; UniProt: O95477).  An amphipathic helical region of the N-terminal barrel of the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is critical for ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux (Oram et al., 2008).  PLTP helix 144-163 removes lipid domains formed by ABCA1, stabilizing ABCA1, interacting with phospholipids, and promoting phospholipid transfer by direct interactions with ABCA1. May transport sphingosine-1-phosphate (Kobayashi et al., 2009). May protect from cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Tang and Oram, 2009). Mediates efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to apoA-I (Voloshyna and Reiss, 2011).  Hyperglycemia accelerates ABCA1 degradation (Chang et al. 2013).  Human ABCA1 is down regulated upon infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae which inhibits bacterial growth (Korhonen et al. 2013).  Curcumin induces expression of ABCA1 (Tian et al. 2013). May also export retinol and retinyl palmitate (Reboul 2013). The role of ABCA1 in human diseases has been reviewed (Jacobo-Albavera et al. 2021). Production of high density lipoprotein (HDL) requires ABCA1 to drive phospholipid (PL) from the plasma membrane into extracellular apolipoprotein A-I. Segrest et al. 2022 showed that domains of ABCA1 within the plasma membrane remove PL from the membrane's outer leaflet. After the lipid diffuses into the interior of ABCA1's outward-open cavity, PL extracted by the gateway passes through a ring-shaped domain, the annulus orifice, which forms the base of an elongated hydrophobic tunnel in the transporter's extracellular domain. Engineered mutations in the gateway and annulus inhibit lipid export by ABCA1 without affecting cell-surface expression levels. These finding that ABCA1 extracts lipid from the outer face of the plasma membrane and forces it through its gateway and annulus into an elongated hydrophobic tunnel contrasts with the alternating access model, which proposes that ABCA1 flops PL substrate from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the membrane. Thus, ABCA1 lacks the charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain found in the floppase members of the ABC transporter family (Segrest et al. 2022).  Regulation of lipid metabolism by APOE4 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via the enhancement of ABCA1 membrane expression (Qian et al. 2024).  Tumour metastasis in colorectal cancer occurs via the RAC1/ABCA1 axis (Chen et al. 2024).

3.A.1.211.10	ABCA7. Regulates cellular efflux of phospholipids but not cholesterol, to apo A-1 (Voloshyna and Reiss, 2011).  Associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, possibly by influencing amyloid-β (Abeta) accumulation (Zhao et al. 2014).  Known functions of ABCA7 are summarized in Zhao et al. 2014 and Sakamoto et al. 2019. People with low ABCA7 develop AD neuropathology at a younger age, those with intermediate ABCA7 develop it later, and those who developed it very late had high ABCA7, the same as the youngest controls. ABC transporters closely similar to ABCA7 similarly protect cells by removing toxic lipids (Lyssenko and Praticò 2020). ABCA7 is a genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's Disease risk in african americans (Stepler et al. 2022). Essential pharmacophore features of inhibitory compounds may provide guides to theraputic treatments of AD (Namasivayam et al. 2021). A metabolome-wide association study on ABCA7 indicated a role of ceramide metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (Dehghan et al. 2022). Cryo-EM structures of human ABCA7 provide insights into its phospholipid translocation mechanisms (Le et al. 2023).	Animals

3.A.1.211.13	"ABCA12 keratinocyte lipid transporter of 2595 aas (Shimizu et al. 2014).  Functions in epidermal lipid barrier formation and keratinocyte differentiation (Akiyama 2013).  Defects cause a form of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, a disorder of 
keratinization with abnormal differentiation and desquamation of the 
epidermis, resulting in abnormal skin scaling over the whole body. The 
main skin phenotypes are lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and non-bullous 
congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE) (Akiyama 2013). ABCA12 plays
a role in lipid transport from the Golgi apparatus to lamellar granule in human granular layer
keratinocytes (Sakai et al. 2007).   ABCA12‑associated mutations or alterations in expression  exhibit 
causative or contributive effects to the development of keratinized 
dermatoses, including KP and NC (Liu et al. 2018; Serra et al. 2022)."	Animals
3.A.1.211.14	"cAMP-dependent and sulfonylurea-sensitive anion transporter, ABCA1 (ABCAI) of 2261 aas. It is a key gatekeeper catalyzing intracellular phospholipid and cholesterol transport (Orlowski et al. 2007).  It interacts with the MEGF10 protein and is 95% identical to the mouse orthologue, 3.A.1.211.1.  Cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages decreases in the presence of plasma obtained from humans and rats with mild hyperbilirubinemia. A direct effect of unconjugated bilirubin on cholesterol efflux was demonstrated and is associated with decreased ABCA1 protein expression (Wang et al. 2017). A cryoEM structure (4.1 Å) revealed that the two transmembrane domains contact each other through a narrow interface in the intracellular leaflet of the membrane, and two extracellular domains of ABCA1 enclose an elongated hydrophobic tunnel. Structural mapping of dozens of disease-related mutations allowed potential interpretation of their diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Structure-based analyses suggested a plausible ""lateral access"" mechanism for ABCA1-mediated lipid export that may be distinct from the conventional alternating-access paradigm.  ABCA1 acts in concert with ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018). One substrate of systems ABCA1, ABCB1 and ABCC1 is arsenate, where ABCC1 is most effective while ABCA1 and ABCB1 are less effective (Zhou et al. 2018). ABCA1 transports lipids and cholesterol to apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Castranio et al. 2018). Cholesterol binding to ABCA1 may interfere with ATP binding in both nucleotide-binding domains of the ABCA1 structure (Dergunov et al. 2018).  Adiponectin, possibly acting through AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, plays a key role in promoting ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux (Hafiane et al. 2019). Reverse cholesterol transport or cholesterol efflux is part of an extensive plasma membranes remodelling process in spermatozoa that induces hyperactivated motility and is imperative for fertilization. Cholesterol efflux depends on high density lipoproteins (HDLs) that interact with transmembrane cholesterol transporters, such as ABCA1 and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI; TC# 9.B.39.1.3) (Bernecic et al. 2021). Smoking can influence the expression of the ABCA1 gene, thereby modulating lipid transport processes in macrophages, which are part of the mechanisms of inflammation development (Kotlyarov and Kotlyarova 2021). The cavity enclosed within the ATP-unbound form of ABCA1 is narrow at the distal ends of the TMD as well as the ECD region, substantiating the ""lateral access"" theory (Sunidhi et al. 2021). Curcumin ameliorates lipid metabolic disorder and cognitive dysfunction via ABCA1 (Tian et al. 2021). Insulin downregulates the expression of ABC A-I in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 in a FOXO1 and LXR-dependent manner (Shavva et al. 2022). Loss of function of the ABCA1 gene results in low levels of HDL as well as a concomitant reduction in plasma HexCer levels (Iqbal et al. 2022). Inflammation and immunomodulatory therapies 
influence the relationship between the ABCA1
transporter-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity and coronary 
atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (Karpouzas et al. 2023). Macrophage cholesterol efflux is mediated by ABCA1 and constitutes the initial and rate-limiting step of
 reverse cholesterol transport, displaying a negative correlation 
with the development of atherosclerosis.  Macrophage allosterically activate AMPK (see TC# 8.A.104) to enhance ABCA1 stability by retarding the calpain-mediated degradation pathway (Li et al. 2023)."	Animals

3.A.1.211.2	"The retinal-specific ABC transporter (RIM protein, ABCR or ABCA4) (Stargardt's disease protein, involved in retinal/macular degeneration) in the rod outer segment (Garces et al. 2020). Changes in the oligomeric state of the nucleotide binding domains of ABCR are coupled to ATP hydrolysis and might represent a signal for the TMDs of ABCR to export the bound substrate (Biswas-Fiss 2006). The ABCA4 porter flips N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, a product generated from the photobleaching of rhodopsin, from the lumen to the cytoplasmic side of disc membranes following the photobleaching of rhodopsin, insuring that retinoids do not accumulate in disc membranes (Molday, 2007; Molday et al. 2009; Tsybovsky et al. 2013). It also transports several vitamin A derivatives (Sun, 2011) and phosphatidylethanolamine in the same 
direction. Mutations, known to cause Stargardt disease, decrease 
N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine transport activities (Quazi et al. 2012). It functions as an inwardly directed retinoid flippase in the visual cycle (Sakamoto et al. 2019). Three cryo-EM structures of human ABCA4, a retina-specific ABCA transporter, in distinct functional states have been solved at resolutions of 3.3-3.4 Å (Xie et al. 2021). In the nucleotide-free state, the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) exhibit a lateral-opening conformation, allowing the lateral entry of substrate from the lipid bilayer. The N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE), the physiological lipid substrate of ABCA4, is sandwiched between the two TMDs in the luminal leaflet and is further stabilized by an extended loop from extracellular domain 1. In the ATP-bound state, the two TMDs display a closed conformation, which precludes substrate binding (Xie et al. 2021). ABCA4 flips N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Ret-PE) from the lumen to the cytoplasmic leaflet of photoreceptor membranes. Loss-of-function mutations cause Stargardt disease (STGD1), a macular dystrophy associated with severe vision loss. Scortecci et al. 2021 determined the cryo-EM structure of ABCA4 in its substrate-free and bound states. The two structures are similar and delineate an elongated protein with the two TMSs forming an outward facing conformation, extended and twisted exocytoplasmic domains (ECD), and closely opposed nucleotide binding domains. N-Ret-PE is wedged between the two TMSs and a loop from ECD1 within the lumenal leaflet, consistent with a lateral access mechanism. It is stabilized through hydrophobic and ionic interactions with residues from the TMSs and ECDs (Scortecci et al. 2021). ABCA4 retinopathy-associated variants may be associated with retinal structure and subclinical disease (Simcoe et al. 2023). Stargardt disease-associated in-frame ABCA4 exon 17 skipping results in significant ABCA4 function (Kaltak et al. 2023)."	Animals

3.A.1.211.5	"The surfactant-secreting porter, ABCA3 (exports lipids and proteins into lamellar bodies).  Fatal surfactant deficiency (FSD) can result from mutations in ABCA3, causing abnormal intracellular localization (type I) or decreased ATP hydrolysis (type II). Other mutations cause pediatric interstitial lung disease (pILD) (Matsumura et al. 2008).  ABCA3 is found in lamellar bodies of lung alveolar type II cells where it probably secretes surfactants (mixture of lipids; e.g., PC) and proteins (e.g., surfactant proteins A, B, C and D) stored in lamellar bodies and exocytosed (Matsumura et al., 2006).  ABCA3 plays an essential role in pulmonary surfactant lipid metabolism and lamellar body biogenesis, probably by transporting these lipids as substrates (Ban et al., 2007).  Cheong et al., 2007 have shown that ABCA3 is critical for lamellar body biogenesis in mice. They suggested it functions in surfactant-protein B processing and lung development late in gestation. Lymphoma exosomes shield target cells from antibody attack, and exosome biogenesis is modulated by lysosome-associated ABCA3 which mediates resistance to chemotherapy. Silencing ABCA3 enhances susceptability of target cells to antibody-mediated lysis. Mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to drugs and antibodies are linked in an ABCA3-dependent pathway of exosome secretion (Aung et al., 2011). Onnée et al. 2021 used the experimental structure of human ABCA4, to model at atomic resolution the human ABCA3 3D structure including transmembrane domains (TMDs), nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and regulatory domains (RDs) in an ATP-bound conformation. They mapped known pathogenic missense variants on this model, pinpointing amino-acids within the NBDs, the RDs and the interfaces between the NBDs and TMDs intracellular helices, which are predicted to play key roles in the structure and/or the function of the ABCA3 transporter (Onnée et al. 2021). The cryo-EM structures of human ABCA3 in two distinct conformations, both at resolution of 3.3 A, have been solved (Xie et al. 2022). In the absence of ATP, ABCA3 adopts a ""lateral-opening"" conformation with the lateral surfaces of TMSs exposed to the membrane and features two positively charged cavities within the TMSs as potential substrate binding sites. ATP binding induces pronounced conformational changes, resulting in the collapse of the potential substrate binding cavities. These results help to rationalize the disease-causing mutations in human ABCA3 and suggest a conserved ""lateral access and extrusion"" mechanism for both lipid export and import mediated by ABCA transporters  (Xie et al. 2022). Cigarette smoke extract combined with LPS reduces ABCA3 expression in chronic pulmonary inflammation, and this may be related to PPARgamma/ P38 MAPK signaling pathway (Zhang et al. 2022). ABCA3 is unstable (Onnée et al. 2022)."	Animals

ABCA12 mutations underlie the three main types of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses: harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. ABCA12 mutations lead to defective lipid transport via lamellar granules in the keratinocytes, resulting in malformation of the epidermal lipid barrier and ichthyosis phenotypes.

to the substrate-binding sites of the vitamin-specific S component. Nickel binds to NikM2 by coordination to four nitrogen atoms in Met1, His2 and His67. These nitrogens form a square-planar geometry, similar to that of the metal ion-binding sites in the amino-terminal Cu2+- and Ni2+-binding (ATCUN) motif (Yu et al. 2013).  Constituents other than NikN2 and NikM2 are not known but may be required for activity (T.

3.A.1.23.6	Cobalt (Co2+) porter (Rodionov et al., 2006).  CbiMN is a bipartite S-subunit with 8 TMSs (Siche et al. 2010). Dynamic interactions of CbiN and CbiM trigger activity of the transporter (Finkenwirth et al. 2019). Substrate binding (S) components rotate within the membrane to expose their binding pockets alternately to the exterior and the cytoplasm. In contrast to vitamin transporters, metal-specific systems rely on additional proteins with essential functions. CbiN, with two TMSs tethered by an extracytoplasmic loop of 37 amino-acid residues is the auxiliary component that temporarily interacts with the CbiMQO2 Co2+ transporter. CbiN induces Co2+ transport activity in the absence of CbiQO2 in cells producing the S component CbiM plus CbiN or a Cbi(MN) fusion. Finkenwirth et al. 2019 showed that any deletion in the CbiN loop abolished transport activity. Protein-protein contacts between segments of the CbiN loop and loops in CbiM were demonstrated, and an ordered structure of the CbiN loop was shown. The N-terminal loop of CbiM, containing three of four metal ligands was partially immobilized in wild-type Cbi(MN) but completely immobile in inactive variants with CbiN loop deletions. Thus, CbiM-CbiN loop-loop interactions facilitate metal insertion into the binding pocket (Finkenwirth et al. 2019).	Proteobacteria

3.A.1.24.1	The L- and D-methionine porter (also transports formyl-L-methionine and other methionine derivatives) (Zhang et al., 2003). The 3.7A structure of MetNI has been solved. An allosteric regulatory mechanism operates at the level of transport activity, so increased intracellular levels of the transported ligand stabilize an inward-facing, ATPase-inactive state of MetNI to inhibit further ligand translocation into the cell (Kadaba et al., 2008).  The structure of an MetQ homologue in Neisseria meningitidis has been solved at 2.25 Å resolution revealing a bound methionine in the cleft between the two domains (Yang et al. 2009). Conformational changes in MetQ provide substrate access through the binding protein to the transmembrane translocation pathway. MetQ likely mediates uptake of methionine derivatives through two mechanisms: in the methionine-bound form, substrate is delivered from the periplasm to the transporter (the canonical mechanism) and in the apo form, it facilitates ligand binding when complexed to the transporter (the noncanonical mechanism). This dual role of substrate-binding proteins was proposed to provide a kinetic strategy for ABC transporters to transport both high- and low-affinity substrates present in a physiological concentration range (Nguyen et al. 2018).

BioN (the EcfT component of the biotin transporter) appears to be required for intramolecular signaling and subunit assembly (Neubauer et al., 2009). The Ala-Arg-Ser and Ala-Arg-Gly signatures in BioN are coupling sites to the BioM ATPases (Neubauer et al., 2011).  Subunit stoicheometries have been estimated with the prediction that there are oligomeric forms of BioM and BioY in the BioMNY complex (Finkenwirth et al. 2010).

ATP binding to the EcfAA' ATPases drives a conformational change that 
dissociates the S subunit from the EcfAA'T ECF module. Upon release from
 the ECF module, the RibU S subunit then binds the riboflavin transport 
substrate.  S subunits for distinct substrates compete 
for the ATP-bound state of the ECF module (Karpowich et al. 2015). RibU appears to be capable of exporting riboflavin, FMN and FAD (Light et al. 2018). More recently, this system has been shown to functioin in three capacities; all use EcfA (Ecf1), EcfB (Ecf2), both ATPases. Two of them also use RibU (EcfS).  The first complex uses EcfT and RibU and imports FAD; the second uses FmnA and RibU and takes up vitamin B2 (riboflavin derivatives); the third uses FmnA and EetB and exports FAD (Rivera-Lugo et al. 2023).

3.A.1.27.3	"ABC transporter maintaining outer membrane (OM) lipid asymmetry, MlaABCDEF (YrbABCDEF) (Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009). MlaA (VacJ) is a ""spreading"" protein, essential for Shigella pathogenicity (Suzuki et al., 1994).  The ABC transporter, MlaEFBD, provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of 
aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner 
membrane (IM) (Thong et al. 2016). MlaD spans the periplasm, forms stable hexamers within the complex, functions in 
substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs within a channel that spans the periplasm, and modulates ATP 
hydrolytic activity. MlaB plays critical roles in both the 
assembly and activity of the transporter.  MlaA forms a complex with OmpC and OmpF in the outer membrane to extract PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (Chong et al. 2015). MlaA is a monomeric 2 α-helical TMS OM protein that functions as a 
phospholipid translocation channel, forming a ~20-Å-thick doughnut 
embedded in the inner leaflet of the OM with a central, amphipathic 
pore (Abellón-Ruiz et al. 2017). This architecture prevents access of inner leaflet phospholipids 
to the pore, but allows outer leaflet phospholipids to bind to a pronounced ridge surrounding the 
channel. Members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family, one of which is MlaD, form hexameric 
assemblies with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport across the periplasm (Ekiert et al. 2017). 
MlaD forms a ring associated with the ABC 
transporter complex in the inner membrane. A soluble lipid-binding 
protein, MlaC ferries lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein
 complex. EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins 
show that YebT (LetB) forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE 
rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB 
create channels of sufficient length to span the periplasmic space. These homologs transport lipids between the two membranes of 
Gram-negative bacteria, some eukaryotic organelles and possibly actinobacteria (Ekiert et al. 2017). MCE systems mediate phospholipid trafficking across the periplasm. ~3.5 Å cryo-EM structures of the E. coli MCE protein 
LetB reveals an ~0.6 megadalton complex that consists of seven stacked 
rings, with a central hydrophobic tunnel sufficiently long to span the 
periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). Lipids bind inside the tunnel, suggesting that it functions 
as the pathway for lipid transport. Cryo-EM structures in the open and 
closed states revealed a dynamic tunnel lining with implications for 
gating and substrate translocation. These results support a model in which 
LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a
 hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the 
periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). The transmembrane subunit, MlaE, has minimal sequence similarity to other transporters. Coudray et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of MlaFEDB at 3.05 Å resolution, revealing distant relationships to the LPS and MacAB transporters, as well as members of the eukaryotic ABCA/ABCG families. A continuous transport pathway extends from the MlaE substrate- binding site, through the channel of MlaD, and into the periplasm. Two phospholipids are bound to MlaFEDB, suggesting that multiple lipid substrates may be transported each cycle. The structure provides mechanistic insight into substrate recognition and transport by MlaFEDB (Coudray et al. 2020). Structures of both the E. coli and P. aeruginosa MlaFEDB complexes have been determined by cryoEM (Zhou et al. 2021). The structures show that the MlaFEBD complex contains a total of twelve protein molecules with a stoichiometry of MlaF2E2B2D6, and binds a plethora of phospholipids (PLs) at different locations. In contrast to canonical ABC transporters, nucleotide binding fails to trigger significant conformational changes of both MlaFEBD and MlaFEB in the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane domains, correlated with their low ATPase activities exhibited in both detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. PLs or detergents appeared to relocate to the membrane-proximal end from the distal end of the hydrophobic tunnel formed by the MlaD hexamer in MlaFEBD upon addition of ATP, indicating that retrograde PL transport might occur in the tunnel in an ATP-dependent manner. Site-specific photocrosslinking experiment confirmed that the substrate-binding pocket in the dimeric MlaE and the MlaD hexamer are able to bind PLs in vitro, in line with the notion that the MlaFEBD complex functions as a PL transporter (Zhou et al. 2021).  Mla uses a shuttle-like mechanism to move lipids between the MlaFEDB 
inner membrane complex and the MlaA-OmpF/C OM complex, via a periplasmic
 lipid-binding protein, MlaC. MlaC binds to MlaD and MlaA (MacRae et al. 2023). They mapped the MlaC-MlaA and MlaC-MlaD protein-protein interfaces, suggesting that the MlaD and MlaA binding surfaces on MlaC overlap to a 
large extent, leading to a model in which MlaC can only bind one of 
these proteins at a time. Low-resolution cryo-EM maps of MlaC bound to MlaFEDB suggested that at least two MlaC 
molecules can bind to MlaD at once, in a conformation consistent with 
AlphaFold2 predictions (MacRae et al. 2023). The Mla system of the diderm Firmicute, Veillonella parvula, reveals an ancestral transenvelope bridge for phospholipid trafficking (Grasekamp et al. 2023)."	Proteobacteria

In the crystal structure of the MCE domain of Mce4A (MtMce4A39-140) a domain-swapped conformation is observed. The fact that there are six SBPs in each Mtb mce operon suggests that the MceA-F SBPs from Mce1-4 may form heterohexamers. The helical domains interact with the detergent micelle, suggesting that when assembled, the helical domains of MceA-F may form a hydrophobic pore for lipid transport, as observed in PqiB of E. coli (Asthana et al. 2021).

FliY binds L-cystine, L-cysteine, and D-cysteine with micromolar affinities, but binding of the L- and D-enantiomers induced different conformational changes in FliY, where the L- enantiomer/SBP complex interacted more efficiently with the YecSC transporter. YecSC has low basal ATPase activity that is moderately stimulated by apo-FliY, more strongly by D-cysteine-bound FliY, and maximally by L-cysteine- or L-cystine-bound FliY (Sabrialabe et al. 2020). FliY may exist in a conformational equilibrium between an open, unliganded form that does not bind to the YecSC transporter and closed, unliganded and closed, liganded forms that bind this transporter with variable affinities but equally stimulate its ATPase activity. These findings differ from previous observations for similar ABC transporters, highlighting the extent of mechanistic diversity in this large protein family (Sabrialabe et al. 2020).	Proteobacteria

It may influence glycosylation due to its Mn2+ transport activity that regulates Mn2+ homeostasis in the golgi (Thines et al. 2018). TMEM165 is also required for milk production (Snyder et al. 2019). Human Both Ca2+ and Mn2+ are required for proper protein glycosylation in cells (Stribny et al. 2020). TMEM165, a Golgi transmembrane protein, is a novel marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, and its depletion impairs invasion activity (Lee et al. 2018).

3.A.26.1.1	"The Plasmodium Translocon of Exported proteins (PTEX) complex included Exp2 (283 aas; one N-terminal TMS plus 8 putative TM β-strands), Clp protease and ATPase (ClpB2), and translocon components, PTEX150 (993 aas with one N-terminal TMS and as many as 22 TM putative β-strands), pTEX88 (777 aas with one or two N-terminal α-helical TMSs and as many as 30 TM β-strands, and thioredoxin-2 (Trx2; 157 aas, one N-terminal TMS).  ClpB2 is an ATP-dependent protein unfoldase and chaparone that may energize substrate protein unfolding and export; it is not clear if the Clp protease is involved. 3-d structures are known for some components (AhYoung et al. 2015).  It has been suggested that the Exp-2 protein serves as the channel for export (Mesén-Ramírez et al. 2016), and this has been demonstrated (Hakamada et al. 2016). EXP2 formed pores in bilayer lipid membranes with an inner diameter of approximately 3.5 nm. The pore 
consists of 10-12 EXP2 subunits (Hakamada et al. 2017), and the N-terminus of EXP2 plays a role in pore formation (Sanders et al. 2018). An additional component of the complex may be Pf113 (Miyazaki et al. 2021). EXP2, the transmembrane protein of a translocon from malaria parasites has pore-forming properties in the lipid bilayer and forms a nanopore with a diameter of 2.5 nm assembled from 7 monomers. Using the EXP2 nanopore allowed  detection of poly-L-lysine (PLL) at a single-molecule level. The EXP2 nanopore has sufficient resolution to distinguish the difference in molecular weight between two individual PLL, long PLL (MW: 30,000-70,000) and short PLL (MW: 10,000) and thus functions as a peptide-detectable nanopore (Miyagi et al. 2021). Many proteins interacting with SBP1 have been identified, two of which are promising membrane-associated proteins  identified as pre-export interactors, and one of these possesses a predicted translocon domain that could facilitate the export of membrane proteins (Anaguano et al. 2023).

The enzyme can catalyze oxidation of sulfide to sulfite and sulfite to thiosulfate in an exergonic reaction that is pmf-independent (Stoffels et al. 2012). Because the endoergonic reaction is dependent on the pmf, there may be a proton channels in the complex, (possibly subunit C) that allows proton flux into the cell, coupled to the reduction reaction.

normally abundant at apical membranes, where they tether membrane-delimited transporters. NHERF
expression is particularly high at the apical membrane in polarized tissue such as intestinal,
hepatic, and renal epithelial tissues (Walsh et al. 2015). DLG4 or PSD95 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA
 receptor subunits and shaker-type potassium channels and is required for 
synaptic plasticity associated with NMDA receptor signaling. 
Overexpression or depletion of DLG4 changes the ratio of excitatory to 
inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, DLG4 may reduce the amplitude of 
ASIC3 acid-evoked currents by retaining the channel intracellularly. It also
 regulates the intracellular trafficking of ADR1B and controls 
AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) immobilization at postsynaptic 
density, keeping the channels in an activated state in the presence of 
glutamate and preventing synaptic depression.  This involves palmitoylation (Jeyifous et al. 2016). Stargazin in complex with PSD-95 or PSD-95-assembled postsynaptic 
complexes forms highly concentrated and dynamic condensates via phase 
separation, reminiscent of stargazin/PSD-95-mediated AMPAR synaptic 
clustering and trapping (Zeng et al. 2019). AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission is well established. PSD-95 captures AMPARs via an interaction with the AMPAR auxiliary subunits-transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs).

8.A.24.2.4	"Brain nitric oxide synthase, NOS1, of 1434 aas and probably 0 TMSs. It produces nitric oxide (NO) which is a messenger molecule with diverse 
functions throughout the body. In the brain and peripheral nervous 
system, NO displays many properties of a neurotransmitter. It probably has 
nitrosylase activity and mediates cysteine S-nitrosylation of 
cytoplasmic target proteins such SRR. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental 
disorders. Sun et al. 2022 designed a fast-onset antidepressant that works by 
disrupting the interaction between the serotonin transporter (SERT; TC# 2.A.22.1.1) and 
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN).
 Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) selectively increases the 
SERT-nNOS complex in the DRN in mice. Augmentation of SERT-nNOS 
interactions in the DRN causes a depression-like phenotype and accounts
 for CMS-induced depressive behaviors. Disrupting the SERT-nNOS 
interaction produces a fast-onset antidepressant effect by enhancing 
serotonin signaling in forebrain circuits. A
small-molecule compound, ZZL-7 elicits an antidepressant effect 2
 hours after treatment without undesirable side effects. This compound, 
or analogous reagents, may serve as a new, rapidly acting treatment for 
MDD (Sun et al. 2022)."	NOS1 of Homo sapiens

However, if homologous, this suggests that there was a rearrangement between the two families so that TMSs 1 - 7 in this protein corresponds to TMS 4 - 10 in MnhD (P60686) in the multisubunit Mnh cation exchanger (2.A.63.1.3).  The fact that both systems catalyze the same reaction also suggests that these two families are part of a superfamily.

2.A.96.1.1	"Acetate/succinate transporter, SatP or YaaH of 196 aas and 6 TMSs (Sá-Pessoa et al. 2013).  It is specific for acetate (a monocarboxylate) and for succinate (a dicarboxylate), with affinity constants at 
pH 6.0 of 1.24 ± 0.13 mM for acetate and 1.18 ± 0.10 mM for succinate. In 
glucose grown-cells, the ΔyaaH mutant is compromised for the uptake of 
both labelled acetic and succinic acids. YaaH, together with ActP, 
previously described as an acetate transporter, affect the use of acetic
 acid as a sole carbon and energy source. Both genes have to be deleted 
simultaneously to abolish acetate transport. The uptake of acetate and 
succinate was restored when yaaH was expressed in trans in ΔyaaH ΔactP cells. YaaH amino acid residues
 Leu131 and Ala164 are important for the enhanced ability to transport lactate (Sá-Pessoa et al. 2013). The 3-d structure has been determined to 2.8 Å resolution showing that it is a hexamer with each protomer having a central pore surrounded by 6 TMSs (Sun et al. 2018) (see family description for more details). Wu et al. 2019 suggested that channel opeining involves repacking of key residues, such as Gln50 and Phe17, as well as the subsequent outward movement of all transmembrane helices. Their simulations suggested that acetate is always surrounded by several water molecules when passing through the anion channel, and a high energy barrier of 15 kcal/mol was observed (Wu et al. 2019). SatP from Citrobacter koseri (92% identical to the E. coli ortholog) in liposomes and native nanodiscs has been examined structurally using solid state NMR, revealing the common helical structures in their transmembrane domains (Dong et al. 2021). It is not certain that SatP is a carrier or a channel."	Bacteria

Two conformations of the 3-d structure have been determined at 1.65 and 2.35 Å resolution, respectively (Luo et al., 2015). UlaA (SgaT) forms a homodimer with a novel fold. Each UlaA protomer consists of 11 TMSs arranged into a 'V-motif' domain and a 'core' domain. The V motifs form the interface between the two protomers, and the core-domain residues coordinate vitamin C. Alternating access of the substrate to the two sides of the cell membrane may be achieved through rigid-body rotation of the core relative to the V motif (Luo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2003).

9.B.36.1.1	"The acid resistance 6 TMS HdeD protein of 190 aas. The yhiD and hdeD gene products participate in an 
acid resistance mechanism exhibited only at high cell densities (Mates et al. 2007). H-NS directly controls expression of the hedD gene (Krin et al. 2010).  Both small RNAs, CyaR and RprA, interact with the 5'-UTR of hdeD mRNA, and binding to the RBS of hdeD, interfers with translational initiation. Lalaouna et al. 2018 identified an A/U-rich motif on hdeD,
 which is bound by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The results indicate that 
binding of this motif by Hfq is required for CyaR-induced degradation of
 hdeD mRNA, and two molecules of RprA must bind the 5'-UTR of hdeD to block translation initiation. While both CyaR and RprA sRNAs bind to the same motif on the hdeD mRNA, RprA solely acts at the translational level, leaving the target RNA intact (Lalaouna et al. 2018).

2.A.53.1.14	Sulfate transporter 4:1, chloroplastic, SULTR4;1, MSH12.1, of 685 aas and 13 - 15 TMSs. It is a H+/sulfate cotransporter that may play a role in the regulation of sulfate assimilation. The structure of AtSULTR4;1, in complex with SO42- at an overall resolution of 2.8 Å has been determined (Wang et al. 2021). AtSULTR4;1 forms a homodimer and has a structural fold typical of the SLC26 family of anion transporters. The bound SO42- is coordinated by side-chain hydroxyls and backbone amides, and further stabilized electrostatically by the conserved Arg393 and two helix dipoles. Proton and SO42- are co-transported, and a proton gradient significantly enhances SO42- transport. Glu347, which is ~7 Å from the bound SO42-, is required for H+-driven transport. The cytosolic STAS domain interacts with the transmembrane domains, and deletion of the STAS domain, or mutations at the interface, compromise dimer formation and reduces SO42- transport, suggesting a regulatory function of the STAS domain (Wang et al. 2021).

2.A.53.2.15	"Solute carrier family 26 member 9 (Anion transporter/exchanger protein 9).  May play a role in chronic inflammatory airway diseases (Sala-Rabanal et al. 2015). The Cl--transporting proteins CFTR (TC# 3.A.1.202.1), SLC26A9, and anoctamin 
(ANO1; ANO6) (see TC family 1.A.17)  all participate in the pathogenic process and clinical outcomes of 
airway and renal diseases (Kunzelmann et al. 2023). The molecular principles underlying diverse functions of the SLC26 family of proteins (Takahashi and Homma 2023).  (i) The basic residue at the anion binding site is essential for both anion antiport of SLC26A4 and motor functions of SLC26A5, and its conversion to a nonpolar residue is crucial but not sufficient for the fast uncoupled anion transport in SLC26A9; (ii) the conserved polar residues in the N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains are likely involved in dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks and are essential for anion antiport of SLC26A4 but not for motor (SLC26A5) and uncoupled anion transport (SLC26A9) functions; (iii) the hydrophobic interaction between each protomer's last transmembrane helices, TM14, is not of functional significance in SLC26A9 but crucial for the functions of SLC26A4 and SLC26A5, likely contributing to optimally orient the axis of the relative movements of the core domain with respect to the gate domains within the cell membrane (Takahashi and Homma 2023)."	Animals
2.A.53.2.16	Sulfate anion transporter 1 (SAT-1 or SAT1) (Solute carrier family 26 member 1); anion exchanger.  Transports chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate and oxalate (Regeer et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2003).  The mouse and rat orthologues have the same specificities and functions. Loss in mice  is associated with hyperoxalurea and calcium oxalate kidney stones, and specific mutations when heterozygous in humans cause urolithiasis (Dawson et al. 2013).  When homozygous, they can cause severe nephrocalcinosis. SLC26A1 is a major determinant of sulfate homeostasis in humans (Pfau et al. 2023).	Animals
2.A.53.2.17	"Pendrin (Sodium-independent chloride/iodide/bicarbonate transporter) (Solute carrier family 26 member 4, Slc26a4; PDS).  Involved in ion homeostasis of the endolymph of the inner ear.  Missense mutations cause sensorineuronal hearing loss, but salicylate (aspirin) restored transport function by allowing transport from cytosolic sites to the plasma membrane (Ishihara et al. 2010). May also transport cyanate and thiocyanate (Pedemonte et al. 2007). May play a role in chronic inflammatory airway diseases (Sala-Rabanal et al. 2015). SLC26A4 functional expression may reduce or prevent fluctuation of hearing (Nishio et al. 2016). Iodide transport across thyrocytes constitutes a critical step for 
thyroid hormone biosynthesis, mediated mainly by the basolateral NIS (TC# 2.A.21.5.1) and
 the apical anion exchanger pendrin (PDS) (Eleftheriadou et al. 2020). Type II alveolar epithelial cell-specific loss of the small GTPase, RhoA, exacerbates allergic airway inflammation through pendrin (Do et al. 2021). Pendrin maintains ion concentrations in the endolymph of the inner ear, most likely by acting as a chloride/bicarbonate transporter. Variants in the SLC26A4 gene are responsible for sensorineural hearing loss. Although pendrin localizes to the plasma membrane, 8 missense allele products of SLC26A4 were retained in the intracellular region and lost their anion exchange function (Murakoshi et al. 2022). 10 mM salicylate induced the translocation of 4 out of 8 allele products from the intracellular region to the plasma membrane and restored their anion exchanger activities. 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol restored the localization of the p.H723R allele products of SLC26A4 from the ER to the plasma membrane at a concentration of 1 mM by 3 h after its administration with less cytotoxicity than 10 mM salicylate (Murakoshi et al. 2022). Mutations of coding regions and splice sites of SLC26A4 cause Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss DFNB4. SLC26A4 is an exchanger of anions and bases. The mutant SLC26A4 phenotype is characterized by inner ear malformations, including an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), incomplete cochlear partition type II and modiolar hypoplasia, progressive and fluctuating hearing loss, and vestibular dysfunction (Honda and Griffith 2022).  Pendrin (SLC26A4) is an anion exchanger that mediates bicarbonate (HCO3-) exchange for chloride (Cl-) and is crucial for maintaining pH and salt homeostasis in the kidney, lung, and cochlea. Pendrin also exports iodide (I-) in the thyroid gland. Pendrin mutations in humans lead to Pendred syndrome, causing hearing loss and goiter.  Niflumic acid (NFA) inhibits pendrin by competing with anion binding and impeding the structural changes necessary for anion exchange (Wang et al. 2024)."	Animals
2.A.53.2.18	Chloride anion exchanger (Down-regulated in adenoma) (Protein DRA) (Solute carrier family 26 member 3).  The intracellular pH regulates ion exchange (Hayashi et al. 2009). Reduced functional expression of NHE3, and DRA contribute to Cl- and Na+ stool loss in microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) diarrhea (Kravtsov et al. 2016). Mutations cause Congenital Chloride Diarrhea (CCD), an autosomal recessive disease in humans.  Upon infection with Salmonella, DRA levels go down, preventing Cl- absorption giving rise to diarrhea (A. Quach, personal communication). NHE-3 (TC# 2.A.53.2.18) was markedly downregulated, while the Na+-HCO3--cotransporter (NBC-1; TC# 2.A.31.2.12) and Na+-glucose transporter type-2 (SGLT2 or SGLT-2; TC#2.A.1.7.26) were upregulated after kidney transplantation (Velic et al. 2004).	Animals
2.A.53.2.19	"Prestin (Solute carrier family 26 member 5).  The motor protein responsible for the somatic electromotility of cochlear outer hair
cells (OHC); essential for normal hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity in mammals. Prestin
transports a wide variety of monovalent and divalent anions. Many SulP transporters have C-terminal hydrophilic STAS domains that are essential for plasma membrane targeting and protein
function. The crystal structure of this STAS
domain has been solved at 1.57
Å resolution (Pasqualetto et al. 2010).  It senses voltage and binds anions for induction of conformational changes (He et al. 2013).  Prestin's  7+7 inverted repeat
architecture suggests a central cavity as the substrate-binding site located midway within
the anion permeation pathway. Anion binding to this site controls the electromotile activity of prestin (Gorbunov et al. 2014).  Zhai et al. 2020 studied the maturation of voltage-induced shifts in the Prestin operating point during trafficking. Calmodulin binds to the STAS domain with a calcium-dependent, one-lobe, binding mode (Costanzi et al. 2021). Prestin is the molecular actuator that drives OHC electromotility (eM). eM is mediated by an area motor mechanism, in which prestin proteins act as elementary actuators by changing their area in the membrane in response to changes in membrane potential. The area changes of a large and densely packed population of prestin molecules add up, resulting in macroscopic cellular movement. At the single protein level, this model implies major voltage-driven conformational rearrangements. SLC26 transporters including prestin generally are dimers. Lenz and Oliver 2021 reviewed the structures and discussed insights into a potential molecular mechanism. Distinct conformations were observed when purifying and imaging prestin bound to either its physiological ligand, chloride, or to competitively inhibitory anions, sulfate or salicylate. These structural snapshots indicate that the conformational landscape of prestin includes rearrangements between the two major domains of prestin's transmembrane region (TMD), core and scaffold ('gate') domains. Distinct conformations differ in the area the TMD occupies in the membrane and in their impact on the immediate lipid environment. Both effects can contribute to the generation of membrane deformation and thus may underly electromotility. Possibly, these or similar structural rearrangements are driven by the membrane potential to mediate piezoelectric activity (Lenz and Oliver 2021). Prestin differs from other Slc26 family members due to its unique piezoelectric-like property that drives OHC electromotility, the putative mechanism for cochlear amplification. Butan et al. 2022 used cryo-EM to determine prestin's structure at 3.6 Å resolution. Prestin was captured in an inward-open state which may reflect prestin's contracted state. Two well-separated transmembrane (TM) domains and two cytoplasmic sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist (STAS) domains form a swapped dimer. The TM domains consist of 14 TMSs in two 7+7 inverted repeats, an architecture first observed in the bacterial symporter UraA. Mutation of prestin's chloride binding site removes salicylate competition with anions while retaining the prestin characteristic displacement currents (Nonlinear Capacitance), undermining the extrinsic voltage sensor hypothesis for prestin function (Butan et al. 2022). A structure-based mechanism for the membrane motor prestin has been presented (Ge et al. 2021). A novel role of the folding equilibrium of the anion-binding site in defining prestin's unique voltage-sensing mechanism and electromotility has been proposed (Lin et al. 2023)."	Animals

2.A.53.2.3	Intestinal down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) protein;  HCO3-/Cl- antiporter, SLC26a3 (responsible for congenital chloride-losing diarrhea in humans) (Schweinfest et al., 2006). DRA has 12 putative TMSs and a C-terminal STAS domain required for function and activation of CFTR by DRA (Dorwart et al., 2008).  Catalyzes 2Cl-/1HCO3- antiport, Cl-/OH- exchange and sulfate transport (Shcheynikov et al., 2006; Moseley et al., 1999). Loss in mice impairs mucosal HCO3- secretion (Xiao et al., 2012).	Animals

Anions transported: iodide (thyroid gland; apical membrane of follicular epithelium); bicarbonate (kidney; apical membrane of intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct), chloride, formate, etc. Pendrin probably catalyzes uniport and anion/anion antiport (SLC26A4). It also regulates Na+ absorption by the epithelial Na+ channel (Wall and Pech, 2008). CFTR controls the rate of liquid secretion while pendrin mediates transcellular HCO3- secretion in airway serous cells (Garnett et al., 2011).   A structural model has been presented (Bassot et al. 2016).	Animals
2.A.53.2.5	"Prestin, the outer hair cell voltage-sensitive motor protein (voltage sensitivity depends on intracellular Cl- and HCO3- which may bind to prestin). Prestin transports anions including formate and oxalate; transport and voltage-sensing capabilities are independent functions of the same protein (Bai et al., 2009). Prestin-mediated electromotility is a dual-step process: transport of anions by an alternate access cycle, followed by an anion-dependent transition generating electromotility (Schaechinger et al., 2011; McGuire et al., 2011).  A three-dimensional molecular dynamics model of prestin predicted that it contains eight transmembrane spanning segments and two helical re-entry loops. Tyrosyl
residues recognize anions, with residues Y367,
Y486, Y501 and Y508 contributing to anion binding through
anion-pi interactions. Such interactions, sensitive to voltage and mechanical stimulation,

2.A.53.3.10	Vacuolar membrane protein, YGR125W, basic amino acid (arginine, etc.) transporter of 1036 aas and 10 - 13 TMSs (Kawano-Kawada et al. 2021). The membrane domain is found in the central part of the protein, residues 210 - 630 with large hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains. The large C-terminal domain may be a PE-PGRS family domain, some of which may be outer membrane porins (see TC# 9.B.96), and there may be an additional TMS at the C-terminus. Vacuolar levels of basic amino acids drastically decrease in Δygr125w cells. An expression plasmid of YGR125w with HA3-tag inserted in its N-terminal hydrophilic region restored the vacuolar levels of basic amino acids. Uptake of arginine into vacuolar membrane vesicles depended on HA3-YGR125w expression. A conserved aspartate residue in the first TMS (D223) was indispensable for the accumulation of basic amino acids. YGR125w is also designated VSB1. Thus, Ygr125w/Vsb1 contributes to (1) the uptake of arginine into vacuoles and (2) vacuolar compartmentalization of basic amino acids (Kawano-Kawada et al. 2021).	Fungi

Also transports dicarboxylic acids including fumarate, aspartate and succinate, and is therefore designated the dicarboxylic acid uptake system A (DauA) (Karinou et al. 2013) It is the only succinate uptake porter at acidic pHs. The STAS domain forms a complex with the acyl carrier protein, ACP and malonyl-ACP, and the complex has been determined by x-ray crystallography (PDB# 3NY7).  This complex links bicarbonate and dicarboxylate transport in some way with fatty acid biosynthesis (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012).

2.A.53.3.14	Bicarbonate:Na+ symporter of 564 aas and 11 putative TMSs. Crystal structures of the transmembrane domain (BicA(TM)) and the cytoplasmic STAS domain (BicA(STAS)) of BicA were solved (Wang et al. 2019). BicA(TM) was captured in an inward-facing HCO3--bound conformation with a '7+7' fold monomer. HCO3- bound to a cytoplasm-facing hydrophilic pocket within the membrane. BicA(STAS) is a compact homodimer, required for the dimerization of BicA. The dimeric structure of BicA was further analysed using cryo-electron microscopy and physiological analysis of the full-length BicA, and may represent the physiological unit of SLC26-family transporters. Comparing the BicA(TM) structure with the outward-facing transmembrane domain structures of other bicarbonate transporters suggested an elevator transport mechanism that is applicable to the SLC26/4 family of sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporters (Wang et al. 2019).

which regulates lumenal pH stability and is required for 
autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Lee et al. 2017). TMEM175 plays a direct and critical role in lysosomal and mitochondrial
functions as well as Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis (Jinn et al. 2017). The 3-D structures of the open and closed channels are known (Oh et al. 2020). Coding variants in TMEM175 which increase the propensity for Parkinson's disease, are likely to be responsible for the association in the TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ locus, which could be mediated by affecting glucocerebrosidase activity (Krohn et al. 2020). It constitutes the major lysosomal potassium channel (Lee et al. 2017) and is the pore-forming subunit of the LysoK(GF) complex, a complex activated by extracellular growth factors (Wie et al. 2021). The LysoK(GF) complex is composed of TMEM175 and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or 
AKT3). In the complex, the
TMEM175 channel is opened by conformational changes in AKT, leading to 
its activation (Wie et al. 2021). The lysoK(GF) complex is required to protect neurons against stress-induced damage.  Hydrophobic gating, exhibited by TMEM175, is the process by which a nanopore may spontaneously dewet to form a ""vapor lock"" if the pore is sufficiently hydrophobic and/or narrow. This occurs without steric occlusion of the pore (Lynch et al. 2021). In addition to lysosomes, protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent regulation also influences TMEM175 currents in the plasma membrane (Pergel et al. 2021). Large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK) and transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) are the only two K+ channels known in lysosomes (Wu et al. 2022). Differential ion dehydration energetics explains selectivity in the non-canonical lysosomal K+channel, TMEM175 (Oh et al. 2022). 4-aminopyridine inhibits the lysosomal channel TMEM175 (Oh et al. 2022). TMEM175 is an evolutionarily distinct lysosomal cation channel whose

4.A.1.1.1	"Glucose porter (PtsG; GlcA; Umg) (transports D-glucose and α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside).  The IIC domain has been crystallized, and x-ray data to 4.5 Å resolution have been described (Zurbriggen et al. 2010).  The system has been manipulated to engineer increased production of aromatic metabolites (Carmona et al. 2015, Vargas-Tah et al. 2015). The presence or absence of D-glucose reflects the transporter before and after release of the transported glucose into the cytoplasm. The transition associated with substrate release appears to require a subtle structural rearrangement in the region that includes hairpin 1 (Kalbermatter et al. 2017).  Mlc (for makes large colonies) represses transcription of the genes 
encoding enzyme I, HPr, EIIBCGlc and EIIABCDMan in defined media that lack PTS
 substrates. When glucose is present, the unphosphorylated form of 
EIIBCGlc sequesters Mlc to the cell membrane, preventing its 
interaction with DNA (Plumbridge 2002, Joyet et al. 2013). The Vibrio Mlc functions similarly (Pickering et al. 2014). A small (43 aa) protein, SgrT, acts in tandem with a well-characterized small RNA during metabolic 
stress, due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic sugar-Ps to help bacterial cells maintain balanced metabolism and continue
 growing. SgrT acts on the glucose

order to allow cells to utilize alternative carbon sources (Lloyd et al. 2017). ptsG mRNA localization to the inner membrane, coupled with the membrane insertion of nascent peptide, mediates Hfq/SgrS-dependent ptsG mRNA destabilization, presumably by reducing second rounds of translation (Kawamoto et al. 2005). SgrT is a small protein of 43 aas that allosterically inhibits IICBGlc. while SgrS is a small RNA coompementary to ptsG mRNA that influences its expression.  The sgrST operon is regulated by SgrR, a glucose-6-P-dependent transcriptional activator (Jeckelmann and Erni 2020)."

1.A.16.1.1	"Formate uptake/efflux permease, FocA.  It catalyzes bidirectional transport, has a pentameric aquaporin-like (TC# 1.A.8) structure, and may function by a channel-type mechanism (Falke et al., 2009; Wang et al. 2009). The structure at 2.25 Å resolution has been determined (Wang et al., 2009).  The protein is encoded in an operon with pyruvate-formate lyase, PflB.  A pyruvate:formate antiport mechanism has been suggested (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012). The C-terminal 6 aas are required for formate transport, but not for homopentamer formation (Hunger et al. 2017).  The N-terminus of FocA interacts with PflB, and this interaction is essential for 
optimal formate translocation (Doberenz et al. 2014). In fact, the GREs, TdcE and PflB, interact with the FNT channel protein, probably to control formate translocation by FocA (Falke et al. 2016). The lipophilic constrictions of FocA mainly act as barriers to isolate the central histidine from the aqueous bulk, preventing protonation via proton wires. Thus, an FNT transport model is supported in which the central histidine is uncharged, and weak acid substrate anion protonation occurs in the vestibule regions of the transporter before passing the constrictions (Schmidt and Beitz 2021). An interplay between the conserved pore residues Thr-91 and His-209 controls formate translocation through the FocA channel (Kammel et al. 2022). T91 is essential for formate permeation in both directions; however, it is particularly important to allow anion efflux. H209 is essential for formate uptake by FocA, strongly suggesting that protonation-deprotonation of this residue plays a role in formate uptake. These observations substantiate the premise that efflux and influx of formate by FocA are mechanistically distinct processes that are controlled by the interplay between T91 and H209 (Kammel et al. 2022)."

A projection structure at 6.5 Å resolution has been published (Casagrande et al., 2008), and the 3.2 Å resolution X-ray structure was determined by Fang et al., 2009 and Gao et al., 2009. Protonation of glutamate 208 induces release of agmatine in the outward-facing conformation (Zomot and Bahar, 2011). The 3.0 Å structure of an Arg-bound form in an open-to-out conformation completed the picture of the major states of the porter during the transport cycle (Kowalczyk et al., 2011).

Treatment of a blood-brain barrier (BBB) mimetic with CAT-1 substrates as well as knockdown of CAT-1 expression yielded increases in leptin transport.Thus, an amino acid transporter is a regulator of leptin BBB transport in the iPSC-derived BBB model. These results provide insight into regulation of hormone transport across the BBB (Shi et al. 2022).   It is a possible drug target for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs), rare neuroendocrine tumors (Vit et al. 2023).

2.A.3.4.1	"The single high affinity plasma membrane choline transporter of 563 aas and 12 TMSs. Expression of the CTR/HNM1 gene in wild-type cells is regulated by phospholipid precursors,

There is no regulation by INO2 and OPI1 in the absence of a conserved decamer

substrates of the choline permease, i.e., ethanolamine, nitrogen mustard 
and nitrogen half mustard do not regulate expression of CTR/HNM1 (Li and Brendel 1993). Exposing cells to increasing levels of choline results in two different regulatory mechanisms. Initial exposure to choline results in a rapid decrease in Hnm1-mediated transport activity, whereas chronic exposure results in Hnm1 degradation through an endocytic mechanism that depends on the

GadC, comprising 12 TMSs, exists in a closed state, with its carboxy-terminal domain serving as a plug to block an otherwise inward-open conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed the essential transport residues, identified the transport path and suggested a transport mechanism involving the rigid-body rotation of a helical bundle for GadC and other amino acid antiporters.  Both this glutamate- and the arginine (AdiC; TC#2.A.3.2.5)-dependent acid resistance systems increase the internal pH and reverse the transmembrane potential (Richard and Foster 2004).

2.A.3.8.1	"L-type neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1 (Na+-independent) (prefers amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains: Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, His; catalyzes obligatory exchange with μM affinities on the outside and mM affinities on the inside [1000x difference]).    Both LAT1 and LAT2 (2.A.3.8.6) catalyze uptake of S-nitroso-L-cysteine.  These and other LAT family members are specifically inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (Li and Whorton, 2005). Mediates tryptophan:kynurenine exchange (Kaper et al., 2007). Also transports thyroid hormones and their derivatives (Kinne et al., 2011; Krause and Hinz 2017; Krause and Hinz 2019).  The chicken orthologue transports thyrold hormones, especially T2, with low affinity (Nele Bourgeois et al. 2016). 
      
      Lat1 transports 26 biologically active ultrashort peptides (USPs) into cells as is also true of LAT2 and
 PEPT1 (Khavinson et al. 2023). The sizes and structures of 
ligand-binding sites of the amino acid transporters LAT1, LAT2, and of 
the peptide transporter PEPT1 are sufficient for the transport of the 26
 biologically active di-, tri-, and tetra-peptides. Comparative analyses
 of the binding of all possible di- and tri-peptides (8400 compounds) at
 the binding sites of the LAT and PEPT family transporters was considered (Khavinson et al. 2023). The 26 biologically active USPs systematically showed 
higher binding scores to LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1, as compared with di- and
 tri-peptides. Most of 
the 26 studied USPs were found to bind to the LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1 
transporters more efficiently than the previously known substrates or inhibitors of
 these transporters. Peptides ED, DS, DR, EDR, EDG, AEDR, AEDL, KEDP, 
and KEDG, and peptoids DS7 and KE17 with negatively charged Asp- or Glu- amino acid residues at the N-terminus and neutral or positively charged
 residues at the C-terminus of the peptide were found to be the most 
effective ligands of the transporters under investigation. It can be 
assumed that the antitumor effect of the KE, EW, EDG, and AEDG peptides 
could be associated with their ability to inhibit the LAT1, LAT2, and 
PEPT1 amino acid transporters (Khavinson et al. 2023). LAT1 enables T cell activation under inflammatory conditions in mice (Ogbechi et al. 2023)."	Animals

2.A.3.8.18	"Cystine/glutamate antiporter (Amino acid transport system xCT) (Calcium channel blocker resistance protein CCBR1) (Solute carrier family 7 member 11).  The pathology and development of non-competive  diaryl-isoxazole inhibitors have been presented (Newell et al. 2013).  In Lama paco (alpaca), the Slc7a11 porter of 503 aas and 12 TMSs probably functions in melanogenesis and coat color regulation (Tian et al. 2015).  It interacts with mucin-1 (MUC1-C; P15941) which forms a complex with xCT. It also forms a complex with SLC3A2 heavy chain (CD98hc, 4F2hc or MDU1 (TC# 8.A.9.2.2). Together they maintain glutathione levels and redox balance and influence cancer development (Hasegawa et al. 2016). xCT is the receptor for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, human herpesvirus 8), the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and other lymphoproliferative syndromes often associated with HIV/AIDS (Kaleeba and Berger 2006). Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential, but it seems to have many side effects (Nagane et al. 2018). xCT is a cancer stem cell-related target and can be used to develop preclinical therapeutic approaches, able to hamper tumor growth and dissemination (Ruiu et al. 2019). Residues involved in substrate binding have been proposed based on in silico approaches (Sharma and Anirudh 2019). The tissue distribution of xCT in chickens has been determined (Choi et al. 2020). xCT supports tumor cell growth through glutathione-based oxidative stress resistance, and mutations can enhance its stability (Oda et al. 2020). Signals of pseudo-starvation unveiled that SLC7A11 is key determinant in the control of Treg (T) cell proliferative potential (Procaccini et al. 2021). xCT antiporter function inhibits HIV-1 infection (Rabinowitz et al. 2021). SLC7A11 providess a gateway of metabolic perturbation and ferroptosis vulnerability in cancer (Lee and Roh 2022). CEBPG (CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Gamma) suppresses ferroptosis through transcriptional control of SLC7A11 in ovarian cancer (Zhang et al. 2023). xCT protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and is 
overexpressed in many cancers. Yan et al. 2023 reported that,
 whereas moderate overexpression of SLC7A11 is beneficial for cancer 
cells treated with H2O2, a common oxidative stress inducer, its high overexpression dramatically increases H2O2-induced
 cell death. Mechanistically, high cystine uptake in cancer cells with 
high overexpression of SLC7A11 in combination with H2O2 treatment results in toxic buildup of intracellular cystine and other 
disulfide molecules, NADPH depletion, redox system collapse, and rapid 
cell death (likely disulfidptosis). Additionally, high 
overexpression of SLC7A11 promotes tumor growth but suppresses tumor 
metastasis, likely because metastasizing cancer cells with high 
expression of SLC7A11 are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. 
Our findings reveal that xCT expression level dictates cancer cells'
 sensitivity to oxidative stress and suggests a context-dependent role 
for SLC7A11 in tumor biology (Yan et al. 2023).  By inhibiting the xCT transporter or AMPA receptors in vivo, brain swelling and peritumoral alterations can be mitigated (Yakubov et al. 2023). Butyrate enhances erastin-induced ferroptosis of osteosarcoma cells by regulating the ATF3/SLC7A11 pathway(Nie et al. 2023).  It shows increased activity in ovarian cancer and may be a theraputic target (Fantone et al. 2024; Han et al. 2024)."	Animals
2.A.3.8.19	B(0,+)-type amino acid transporter 1 (B(0,+)AT) (Glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporter b0,+AT1) (Solute carrier family 7 member 9).  The cryo-EM structure of the human heteromeric amino acid transporter b(0,+)AT-rBAT complex has been solved (Yan et al. 2020). The two subunits, a heavy chain and a light chain are linked by a disulfide bridge. The light chain forms a heterodimer with rBAT, a heavy chain which mediates the membrane trafficking of b(0,+)AT. The b(0,+)AT-rBAT complex is an obligatory exchanger, which mediates the influx of cystine and cationic amino acids and the efflux of neutral amino acids in the kidney and small intestine. Yan et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of the human b(0,+)AT-rBAT complex alone and in complex with an arginine substrate at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.3 Å, respectively. The overall structure is a dimer of heterodimers. Arg is bound to the substrate binding site in an occluded pocket. The cryoEM structure reveals a heterotetrameric protein assembly composed of two heavy and two light chain subunits, respectively. The  interaction between the two units is mediated by dimerization of the heavy chain subunits and does not include participation of the light chain subunits (Wu et al. 2020). The b((0,+))AT1 transporter adopts a LeuT fold and is in an inward-facing conformation. An amino-acid-binding pocket is formed by transmembrane helices 1, 6, and 10 and is conserved among SLC7 transporters.	Animals

essential for Brucella infection (Keriel et al. 2015).  In addition to several large neutral L-amino acids, Lat1 in conjunction with 4F2hc, transports S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Li and Whorton 2007), is important for transport of certain drugs into the brain, and is important for cancer (Lee et al. 2019). LAT1/CD98 mediates a Na+ and pH-independent antiport of amino
 acids (Scalise et al. 2018). It has been demonstrated that 
the preferred substrate is histidine, but many large amino acids are also sustrates. CD98 is not required for 
transport, being plausibly involved in routing LAT1 to the plasma 
membrane. Homology models
 have been built on the basis of the AdiC transporter from E.coli.
 Crucial residues for substrate recognition and gating have been 
identified using a combined approach of bioinformatics and site-directed
 mutagenesis coupled to functional assays. LAT1 is involved in important 
human diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer (Scalise et al. 2018). The cryo-EM structure of the human LAT1-CD98hc heterodimer at 3.3-A resolution has been determined (Lee et al. 2019). LAT1 features a canonical Leu T-fold and exhibits an unusual loop structure on transmembrane helix 6, creating an extended cavity that might accommodate bulky amino acids and drugs. CD98hc engages with LAT1 through extracellular, transmembrane and putative cholesterol-mediated interactions. The SLC7A5 (LAT1) gene, which encodes the main transmembrane transporter of large neutral amino acids and of thyroid hormones, exists as variants, one of which is responsible for obesity in patients with phenylketonuria (Bik-Multanowski et al. 2020). SLC7A5 functions in mTORC1 ativation in late endosomes (Jin et al. 2021). It is the main transporter for phenylalanine, and management precautions for risk of obesity are necessary among infants with PKU carrying the rs113883650 variant of the LAT1 gene (Bik-Multanowski et al. 2022). CD98hc is expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in increased amounts (Bianconi et al. 2022). Human LAT1 (SLC7A5)
transports amino acids, thyroid hormones, and drugs such as the 
Parkinson's disease drug levodopa (L-Dopa). It is found in the 
blood-brain barrier, testis, bone marrow, and placenta, and its 
dysregulation has been associated with various neurological diseases, 
such as autism and epilepsy, as well as cancer (Hutchinson et al. 2022). The inhibitor specificities of LAT1 have been described (Hutchinson et al. 2022). SLC7A5 and SLC7A11 can be manipuated to eliminate the barrier to successful CAR-T therapy (Panetti et al. 2022).  Targeting glutamine metabolic reprogramming of SLC7A5 enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in triple-negative breast cancer (Huang et al. 2023). The human LAT1-4F2hc (SLC7A5-SLC3A2) transporter complex has been implicated in physiological and pathophysiological characteristics (Kahlhofer and Teis 2022).  Four cholesterol-binding sites (CHOL1-4) were identified in a recent LAT1-apo
 inward-open conformation cryo-EM structure. Hutchinson and Schlessinger 2024 explored 
the interactions between LAT1 and cholesterol. Their findings suggested that
 CHOL3 forms the most stable and favorable interactions within LAT1."	Animals

2.A.3.8.5	"Cystine/glutamate antiporter, xCT (requires the 4F2hc protein (TC #8.A.9.2.1)). Functions in the generation of glutathione and plays a role in the oxidative stress response (Wang et al. 2015). xCT is involved in the export of 
intracellular glutamate in exchange for extracellular cystine. Glutamate
 is the main neurotransmitter in the retina and plays a key metabolic 
role as a major anaplerotic substrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to
 generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Knight et al. 2023). Glutamate is also 
involved in the outer plexiform glutamate-glutamine cycle, which links 
photoreceptors and supporting Müller cells and assists in maintaining 
photoreceptor neurotransmitter supply. Knight et al. 2023 investigated 
the role of xCT, the light chain subunit responsible for antiporter 
function, in glutamate pathways in the mouse retina using an xCT 
knockout mouse. As xCT is a glutamate exporter,
loss of xCT function could influence the presynaptic metabolism of 
photoreceptors and postsynaptic levels of glutamate, and this proved to be true. Loss of xCT function resulted in glutamate metabolic disruption through 
the accumulation of glutamate in photoreceptors and a reduced uptake of 
glutamate by Müller cells, which in turn decreases glutamine production.
 These findings support the idea that xCT plays a role in the 
presynaptic metabolism of photoreceptors and postsynaptic levels of 
glutamate and derived neurotransmitters in the retina.

2.A.3.8.6	"L-type neutral amino acid transporter, LAT2 (Na+-independent with broad specificity for all L-isomers of neutral amino acids; preferred substrate: Phe, His, Trp, Ile, Val, Leu, Gln, Cys, Ser; catalyzes obligatory exchange with μM affinities on the outside and mM affinities on the inside [1000x difference]).  Both LAT2 and LAT1 (2.A.3.8.1) catalyze uptake of S-nitro-L-cysteine (Li and Whorton, 2005). Also transports thyroid hormones (Kinne et al., 2011). Lat1 transports 26 biologically active ultrashort peptides (USPs) into cells as is also true of LAT2 and
 PEPT1 (Khavinson et al. 2023). The sizes and structures of 
ligand-binding sites of the amino acid transporters LAT1, LAT2, and of 
the peptide transporter PEPT1 are sufficient for the transport of the 26
 biologically active di-, tri-, and tetra-peptides. Comparative analyses
 of the binding of all possible di- and tri-peptides (8400 compounds) at
 the binding sites of the LAT and PEPT family transporters was considered (Khavinson et al. 2023). The 26 biologically active USPs systematically showed 
higher binding scores to LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1, as compared with di- and
 tri-peptides. Most of 
the 26 studied USPs were found to bind to the LAT1, LAT2, and PEPT1 
transporters more efficiently than the previously known substrates or inhibitors of
 these transporters. Peptides ED, DS, DR, EDR, EDG, AEDR, AEDL, KEDP, 
and KEDG, and peptoids DS7 and KE17 with negatively charged Asp- or Glu- amino acid residues at the N-terminus and neutral or positively charged
 residues at the C-terminus of the peptide were found to be the most 
effective ligands of the transporters under investigation. It can be 
assumed that the antitumor effect of the KE, EW, EDG, and AEDG peptides 
could be associated with their ability to inhibit the LAT1, LAT2, and 
PEPT1 amino acid transporters (Khavinson et al. 2023)."	Animals

The structure of PurC has been determined at 2.80 Å resolution (Weng et al. 2023). PurTCp forms a homodimer, and each protomer has 14 
transmembrane segments folded into a transport domain (core domain) and a
 scaffold domain (gate domain). A purine base is present in the 
structure and defines the location of the substrate binding site. 
Functional studies reveal that PurTCp transports purines but 
not pyrimidines and that purine binding and transport is dependent on 
the pH. Mutation of a conserved aspartate residue close to the substrate
 binding site reveals the critical role of this residue in H+-dependent transport of purines. Comparison of the PurTCp structure with transporters of the same structural fold suggests that 
rigid-body motions of the substrate-binding domain are central for 
substrate translocation across the membrane (Weng et al. 2023)."	PurT of Colwellia psychrerythraea

Down-regulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (Liu et al., 2008b).  The structure of the human orthologue with D-glucose bound was solved at 1.5 Å resolution in the outward occluded conformation (Deng et al. 2015).  Sugars are predominantly coordinated by polar
residues in the C-terminal domain. The conformational transition from the outward-open to the outward-occluded states entails a prominent local rearrangement of the extracellular part of 
TMS 7. Comparison of the outward-facing GLUT3 structures with inward-open GLUT1 provides insight
into the alternating access cycle for GLUTs, whereby the C-terminal domain provides the primary
substrate-binding site and the N-terminal domain undergoes rigid-body rotation with respect to
the C-terminal domain (Deng et al. 2015). Glut3 is involved in several disease states in humans (Lechermeier et al. 2019). Resveratrol and soy isoflavones alone and in combination improve the learning and memory of aging rats.

The 2.4 Å structure with glucose bound has been solved, explaining high affinity sugar recognition (Paulsen et al. 2019). The results suggest a proton donor/acceptor pair that links sugar transport to proton translocation. It contains a Lid domain, conserved in all sugar transport proteins, that locks the mobile transmembrane domains through a disulfide bridge, and creates a protected environment which allows efficient coupling of the proton gradient to drive sugar uptake (Paulsen et al. 2019).

2.A.1.1.13	"Fructose uniporter, GLUT5.  The proteins from rat and cow have been crystalized and their structures have been determined in the  open outward- and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. On the basis of comparisons of
the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, a single point mutation proved to be enough to switch the substrate-binding preference from
fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of E. coli XylE suggested that, in addition to a global rocker-switch-like
re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane
bundle helices, TM7 and TM10, underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism (Nomura et al. 2015).  GLUT5 is preferentially used for fructose uptake under (near) anoxic glycolysis to avoid feedback inhibition of phosphofructokinase (Park et al. 2017). Residues involved in fructose recognition have been identified (Ebert et al. 2017). Glucose (Glut-1 and 3) and fructose (Glut-2 and 5) transporter expression and regulation in the hummingbird occur independently of each other (Ali et al. 2020). Complex plastic mechanisms allow adaptation to environmental changes (Huang et al. 2023). C-3 modified 2,5-anhydromannitol (2,5-AM) compounds are inhibitory D-fructose analogues (Rana et al. 2023).  Discrimination of GLUTs by fructose isomers enables simultaneous screening of GLUT5 and GLUT2 activities in live cells (Gora et al. 2023)."

This system affects nutrient minerals concentrations in wheat grains and showed a pleiotropic effect on Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Sulfur (Alomari et al. 2021). In view of its association with sugar uptake porters, we suggest that it is a sugar transporter, and sugar uptake increases the energy of the grains so as to stimulate elemental ion uptake.

2.A.1.1.151	Facilitated trehalose transporter, Tret1-like, of 485 aas and 12 TMSs in a 6 + 6 TMS arrangement. Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects and plays an important role in energy metabolism and stress resistance. Plutella xylostella (L.) is an agricultural pest worldwide. Tret1-like was cloned, knoched out and studied (Zhou et al. 2022). It was found that expression of the gene encoding PxTret1-like was affected by ambient temperature. A knockout mutation of PxTret1-like was generated, and the trehalose content and trehalase activity of the mutant increased at different developmental stages. The trehalose content increased in the fat body of the fourth-instar and decreased in the hemolymph. There was no significant change in glucose in the fat body and hemolymph. Mutant deletion strains of P. xylostella showed a significantly reduced survival rate, fecundity and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. Thus, PxTret1-like could affect the development, reproduction and temperature adaptability of P. xylostella by regulating the trehalose content in the fat body and hemolymph (Zhou et al. 2022).

Using the sea anemone Aiptasia, we show that during symbiosis, the 
increased availability of glucose and the presence of the algae jointly 
induce the coordinated up-regulation and relocalization of glucose and

2.A.1.1.18	Glucose/mannose/fructose transporter and high affinity sensor, Snf3p, (regulates glucose transport via other systems).  Residues involved in ligand preference are similar to those involved in transport (Dietvorst et al. 2010).  Snf3p in Candida glabrata is essential for growth in low glucose media but not high glucose media, and plays a role in the induction of severall hexose transporters (Ng et al. 2015).	Yeast
2.A.1.1.19	Glucose transporter and low affinity sensor, Rgt2p (regulates glucose transport in conjunction with Snf3p). Rgt2 generates an intracellular signal in response to glucose that leads to inhibition of the Rgt1 transcriptional repressor and consequently to derepression of HXT genes encoding glucose transporters. They have unusually long C-terminal tails that bind to Mth1 and Std1, paralogous proteins that regulate the function of the Rgt1 transcription factor. Scharff-Poulsen et al. 2018 showed that the C-terminal tail of Rgt2 is not responsible for its inability to transport glucose. RGT2 mutations that cause constitutive signal generation alter evolutionarily-conserved amino acids in the transmembrane spanning regions involved in maintaining an outward-facing conformation or the substrate binding site. These mutations may cause Rgt2 to adopt inward-facing or occluded conformations that generate the glucose signal. The cytoplasmic C-terminal domains of the yeast cell surface receptors Rgt2 and Snf3 play multiple roles in glucose sensing and signaling (Kim et al. 2024).	Yeast

2.A.1.1.28	"The erythrocyte/brain hexose facilitator, glucose transporter-1, Gtr1. SLC2a1 or Glut1. Transports D-glucose, dehydroascorbate, arsenite and the flavonone, quercetin, via one pathway and water via a distinct channel.   Sugar transport has been suggested to function via a sliding mechanism involving several sugar binding sites (Cunningham et al., 2006). Glut1 is the receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)) (Manel et al., 2003). The orientation of the 12 TMSs and the conformation of the exofacial glucose binding site of GLUT1 have been proposed (Mueckler and Makepeace 2004). It is regulated by stomatin (TC# 8.A.21) to take up dehydroascorbate (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008). Mutations cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome, a human encephalopathy that results from decreased glucose flux through the blood brain barrier (Pascual et al., 2008).  Mueckler and Makepeace (2009) have presented a model of the exofacial substrate-binding site and helical folding of Glut1. Glut1, 2, 4 and 9 are functional both in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (Takanaga and Frommer, 2010). Glut1 is down-regulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (Liu et al., 2008b). Metabolic stress rapidly stimulates blood-brain barrier endothelial cell sugar transport by acute up-regulation of plasma membrane GLUT1 levels, possibly involving an AMP-activated kinase activity (Cura and Carruthers, 2010). Serves as a receptor for neuropilin-1 (923aas; 2 TMSs; O14786) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Hoshino, 2012). Glut1 has a nucleotide binding site, and nucleotide binding affects
transport activity (Yao and Bajjalieh 2009).  The protein serves as a receptor for dermatin and β-adducin which help link the spectrin-actin junctional complex to the erythrocyte plasma membrane (Khan et al. 2008).  May play a role in paroxysmal dyskinesias (Erro et al. 2017). GLUT1 mediates infection of CD4+ lymphocytes by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Jin et al. 2006). Mutations in disordered regions can cause disease by introducing dileucine motifs, For example, mutations that are causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome are of this type, and the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments (Meyer et al. 2018). Glucose transits along a transmembrane pathway through significant rotational motions while maintaining hydrogen bonds with the protein (Galochkina et al. 2019). It is phosphoryated by protein kinase C-B (TC# 8.A.104.1.4) (Lee et al. 2015). GLUT1-mediated exchange of fluorosugars has been studied (Shishmarev et al. 2018). Resveratrol and soy isoflavones alone and in combination improve the 
learning and memory of aging rats. The mechanism may be related to 
up-regulating the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 genes in 
the hippocampus (Zhang et al. 2020). The pore diameters of the transmembrane glucose transporters of all Class I GLUT proteins are constricted upon depletion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membranes (Weijers 2020). Diclofenac inhibits tumor cell glycolysis and growth by decreasing GLUT1 expression (Yang et al. 2021). Almost the entire populations of Glut1 and three other 
transmembrane proteins are immobilized by either the incorporation 
within large multiprotein complexes or entrapment within the protein 
network of the cortical spectrin cytoskeleton (Kodippili et al. 2020). This system is required for hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis (Fang et al. 2021). The main triggers FoR activation of transport are located within the solvent accessible linker regions in the extramembranous zones (Gonzalez-Resines et al. 2021). DHHC9-mediated GLUT1 S-palmitoylation is requuired for plasma membrane localization and promotes glioblastoma glycolysis and tumorigenesis (Zhang et al. 2021). An ancient family of arrestin-fold proteins, termed alpha-arrestins, have conserved roles in regulating nutrient transporter trafficking and
 cellular metabolism as adaptor proteins. One alpha-arrestin, TXNIP 
(thioredoxin-interacting protein), is known to regulate myocardial 
glucose uptake, but the in vivo role of the related alpha-arrestin,
 ARRDC4 (arrestin domain-containing protein 4), was unknown. Interactions of ARRDC4 with GLUT1 prove to mediate metabolic stress in the ischemic heart (Nakayama et al. 2022). Mercury (Hg2+) decreased membrane deformability, impairing RBC capacity to deal with 
the shear forces in the circulation, increasing membrane fragmentation, and affecting transport (Notariale et al. 2022). GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 play important roles in the development of some 
types of malignant tumors, including glioblastoma, and expression of 
both is regulated by miRNAs (Beylerli et al. 2022). Glucose uptake inhibitors via Glut1 are potential anticancer agents (Hung et al. 2022). GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1) is a rare genetic metabolic disease, characterized by infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, and movement disorders (e.g., spasticity and dystonia) (Mauri et al. 2022). It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SLC2A1 gene, which encodes the GLUT1 protein, a glucose transporter across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Most commonly, these variants (~2 dozen) arise de novo, resulting in sporadic cases, although several familial cases with AD inheritance pattern have been described (Mauri et al. 2022). Fluoride exposure affects the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and 3) and ATP synthesis (Chen et al. 2023). GLUT1 is necessary for the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) to survive hypoxia, but overexpression of GLUT1 was insufficient to rescue other skeletal muscles from hypoxic damage (Amorese et al. 2023). The role of GLUT inhibitors, micro-RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs that aid in inhibiting glucose uptake by cancer cells have been discussed as potential theraputics (Chamarthy and Mekala 2023). GLUT1 overexpression in tumor cells is a potential target for drug therapy (Zhao et al. 2023). HSP90B1-mediated plasma membrane localization of GLUT1 promotes radioresistance of glioblastomas (Li et al. 2023).  The core genes (Fgf2, Pdgfra, Ptpn11, Slc2a1) are highly expressed in sevoflurane anesthesia brain tissue samples. The 4 core genes (Fgf2, Pdgfra, Ptpn11, and Slc2a1) are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, brain injuries, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, neurotoxicity, drug-induced abnormalities, neurological disorders, developmental disorders, and intellectual disabilities. Fgf2 and Ptpn11 are highly expressed in brain tissue after sevoflurane anesthesia, the higher the expression level of Fgf2 and Ptpn11, the worse the prognosis (Zhang and Xu 2023). Target separation and potential anticancer activity of withanolide-based glucose transporter protein 1 inhibitors from Physalis angulata var. villosa have been evaluated (Zhang et al. 2023).  PIGT is a subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase which is involved in tumorigenesis and invasiveness.  PIGT promotes cell growth, glycolysis, and 
metastasis in bladder cancer by modulating GLUT1 glycosylation and 
membrane trafficking (Tan et al. 2024)."	Animals
2.A.1.1.29	Glucosamine/glucose/fructose uniporter, Glut-2, Glut2 or ATG9A; it may also transport dehydroascorbate (Mardones et al., 2011; Maulén et al., 2003), and cotransports water against an osmotic gradient (Naftalin, 2008).  Mutations may give rise to the rare autosomal recessive Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (Batool et al. 2019). It mediates intestinal transport of quercetrin (Li et al. 2020) and can transport the drug gastrodin, a seditive with a strcture of a phenolic glucoside (Huang et al. 2023). It also functions in autophagy. The cryoEM structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution has been solved (Guardia et al. 2020). The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the functions of ATG9A. Structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes (Guardia et al. 2020). Both GLUT2 and GLUT3 have been expressed in yeast and exhibit most of the characteristics of the proteins expressed in humans (Schmidl et al. 2020). Autophagy is a highly conserved pathway that the cell uses to maintain homeostasis, degrade damaged organelles, combat invading pathogens, and survive pathological conditions. A set of proteins, called ATG proteins, comprise the core autophagy machinery and work together in a defined hierarchy. ATG9A vesicles are at the heart of autophagy, as they control the rapid de novo synthesis of an organelle called the phagophore. ATG9A is present in different membrane compartments (van Vliet et al. 2023).  Metformin increases the uptake of glucose into the gut from the circulation in high-fat diet-fed male mice, which is enhanced by a reduction in whole-body Slc2a2 expression (Morrice et al. 2023).	Animals
2.A.1.1.3	Xylose (xylopyranose):H+ symporter of 491 aas and 12 TMSs (Wambo et al. 2017).  Also transports and binds D-glucose and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-D-glucose.  The 3-d structure is known in three conformers, outward occluded, inward occluded and inward open (Sun et al. 2012: Quistgaard et al. 2013).  Most of the sugar-binding residues are conserved with the human Glut-1, 2, 3 and 4 homologues.  The coalescence of intramolecular tunnels and cavities has been postulated to account for facilitated diffusion of sugars (Cunningham and Naftalin 2014). Protonation of a conserved aspartate triggers a conformational transition from the outward-facing to the inward-facing state. This transition only occurs in the presence of substrate xylose, while the inhibitor glucose locks the transporter in the outward-facing state (Jia et al. 2020).	Bacteria

uniport mechanism, thus catalyzing uptake as well as efflux. The ITM2B protein Q9Y287; 266 aas and 1 TMS) inhibits urate uptake and stimulates efflux (Mandal and Mount 2019). GLUT9's transcription is regulated by a hepatocyte 
nuclear factor, HNF4α (Prestin et al. 2014). Residues involved in urate transport have been identified (Long et al. 2017). Pathogenic variants of SLC22A12 (URAT1) and SLC2A9 (GLUT9) can give rise to renal hypouricemia (Perdomo-Ramirez et al. 2023)."	Animals

2.A.1.1.76	"Glucose transporter, GT1. GT1, 2, and 3 are homologues. GT2 and GT3 transport ribose as well as glucose at different rates. GT3 transports ribose with 6-fold lower efficiency due to two threonines in GT3 that are alanines in GT2. They are in two loops between TMSs 3, 4, and 7, 8 (Naula et al., 2010). GT1 is expressed in the flagellar membrane and may be both a glucose transporter and sensor, allowing the parasites to enter the 
stationary phase when they deplete glucose although in the absence of 
the sensor, they lose viability (Rodriguez-Contreras et al. 2015)."	Eukaryota

these two residues to alanine (as in GT2) allows transport of ribose. 
Thus, loops 3-4 and 7-8 partially determine substrate specificity (Naula et al., 2010)."	Protozoa

2.A.1.1.80	"Insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter in skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose, and other tissues, Glut4 (GTR4; SLC2A4; 509aas). Defects in Glut4 cause noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Hyperinsulinemia leads to uncoupled insulin regulation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter and the FoxO1 transcription factor (Gonzalez et al., 2011). The first luminal loop confers insulin responsiveness to GLUT4 (Kim and Kandror, 2012). Exercise increases Glut4 synthesis in a process involving several 
protein kinases, the Glut4 enhancer factor (GEF; SLC2A4 regulator; 
Q9NR83), and the myocyte enhancing factor 2 (MEF2; NP_001139257). (McGee and Hargreaves 2006; Wright 2007; Zorzano et al. 2005). monoclonal antibodies against the GLUT4 inward-open and outward-open states have been isoated (Tucker et al. 2018). It is phosphoryated by protein kinase C-β, PRKCB or PKCB (Lee et al. 2015). Insulin-induced GLUT4 transport is observed in the heart and brain in addition to the skeletal muscle and adipocytes, and hormones other than insulin can enhance GLUT4 transport (Wang et al. 2020). Prolonged preoperative fasting induces postoperative insulin resistance by ER-stress mediated Glut4 down-regulation in skeletal muscle (Lin et al. 2021). GLUT4 is the primary glucose transporter in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, and its cellular trafficking is regulated by insulin signaling. Failed or reduced plasma membrane localization of GLUT4 is associated with diabetes. The cryo-EM structures of human GLUT4 bound to a small molecule inhibitor cytochalasin B (CCB) at resolutions of 3.3 Å which exhibits an inward-open conformation. The cryo-EM structure reveals an extracellular glycosylation site and an intracellular helix that is invisible in the crystal structure of GLUT1 (Yuan et al. 2022). Tectorigenin targets PKACα to promote GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle and improve insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo (Yao et al. 2023). Key molecular players in insulin resistance (IR) are the 
insulin receptor and glucose transporter 4, and certain natural products, 
such as lipids, phenols, terpenes, antibiotics and alkaloids have 
beneficial effects on IR which are named ""membrane-active immunomodulators"" (MAIMs) (Izbicka and Streeper 2023). An example is the medium chain fatty acid ester diethyl azelate (DEA), which increases the fluidity of plasma membranes with subsequent 
downstream effects on cellular signaling and improves the symptoms of IR. The intracellular helical bundle of human glucose transporter GLUT4 is important for complex formation with ASP (Huang et al. 2023). Diabetes-induced electrophysiological alterations on neurosomes in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system have been reported (Leal-Cardoso et al. 2023). Regulated dynamic subcellular GLUT4 localization has been revealed by proximal proteome mapping in human muscle cells (Ray et al. 2023). In goats, this system is closely associate with lipid metabolism (Zhang et al. 2024)."	Animals

dehydroascorbate, but not fructose (Seatter et al. 1998, Deng et al. 2015).  GLUT3, a key neuronal transporter, exhibits multiple intermediate states (Sun and Zheng 2019). SLC2A3 may play a role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) classical pathway as well as PD-L1 mediated immune responses (Gao et al. 2021). GLUT3 is consistently upregulated in actively proliferating human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (Paolini et al. 2022). GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 play roles in the development of some types of malignant tumors including glioblastoma, and expression of both is regulated by miRNAs (Beylerli et al. 2022).

Mct-2 uses a different chaperone protein, GP70. Mct-1 also transports the methionine hydroxy analogue 2-hydroxy (4-methylthio) butanate (Martin-Venegas et al., 2007; Becker and Deitmer, 2008). MCT1, 3 and 4 require the ancillary protein, basigin (P35613; 8.A.23.1.1) for plasma membrane localization (Ovens et al., 2010).  It partially localizes to the peroxysomal membrane (Visser et al. 2007). MCT1 is regulated by CD147 proteins, and this association is important for lactate export and cell proliferation in certain cancer cells (Walters et al. 2013).  It is upregulated in some cancers and maintains the metabolic phenotype of these cancer cells by mediating lactate efflux together with a proton, promoting pH homeostasis (Baltazar et al. 2014). MCT-1 functions as a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation via suppression of p53 (Sasa et al. 2018). It  plays a role in aggressive breast cancer subtypes (Li et al. 2018) as well as other cancers (Park et al. 2018).  The SLC16A1 gene is a potential marker to predict race performance in Arabian horses (Ropka-Molik et al. 2019). MCT1 is a negative regulator and MCT2 and a positive regulator of osteoclast differentiation, while MCT2 is required for bone resorption by osteoclasts (Imai et al. 2019). MCTs 1 and 4 are present in increased amounts in solid tumors, and inhibitors as potential therapeutics have been reviewed (Puri and Juvale 2020). Interleukin-1beta induces monocarboxylate transporter-1 in an oxygen tension-dependent manner (Tanaka et al. 2022). Substrate protonation is a pivotal step in the mechanisms of several MCT-unrelated weak acid translocating proteins, but utilization of the proton binding and transfer capabilities of the transporter-bound substrate is probably a universal theme for weak acid anion/H+ cotransport (Geistlinger et al. 2023). This transporter is over expressed in breast cancer (Arponen et al. 2023). Fasting upregulates MCT1 at the rat blood-brain barrier through PPAR δ activation (Chasseigneaux et al. 2024).	Animals
2.A.1.13.10	"MCT8 (SLC16a2) homodimeric monocarboxylate thyroid hormone transporter 8 of 613 or 539 aas and 12 TMSs (Visser et al. 2009; Arjona et al., 2011).  It is the X-linked mental retardation Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) (a severe psychomotor retardation syndrome) protein (Schweizer and Köhrle 2012; Boccone et al. 2010; Johannes et al. 2016). Lack of MCT8 function produces serious neurological disturbances, most likely due to impaired transport of thyroid hormones across brain barriers during development, resulting in severe brain hypothyroidism (Grijota-Martínez et al. 2020). Arg residues important for function have been identified (Groeneweg et al. 2013).  Thyroid hormone (TH) transporters in the brain and across the blood brain barrier have been reviewed (Wirth et al. 2014; Bernal et al. 2015). The product facilitates both TH uptake and efflux across the cell membrane. The disease goes together with low serum T4 and high T3 levels. The mechanisms underlying MCT8-deficient brain development in various animal models including humans has been reviewed (Vancamp and Darras 2017). Together with OATP1C1 (TC# 2.A.60.1.15), MCT8 controls skeletal muscle regeneration (Mayerl et al. 2018).  Deafness and loss of cochlear hair cells occurs in the absence of thyroid hormone transporters, Slc16a2 (Mct8) and Slc16a10 (Mct10) (Sharlin et al. 2018). Stable levels of MCT8 protein in endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, choroid plexus epithelial cells and tanycytes during postnatal development has been demonstrated (Wilpert et al. 2020). Oligomerization involves noncovalent interactions between the N-terminal halves of MCT8 proteins (Groeneweg et al. 2020). Genetic variants in MCT8, cause intellectual and motor disability and abnormal serum thyroid function tests, known as MCT8 deficiency (van Geest et al. 2020). Shaji 2021 identified natural inhibitors against MCT8. Emodin exhibited the best binding energy of -8.6 kcal/mol followed by helenaquinol, cercosporamide and resveratrol. Emodin and helenaquinol exhibit high binding energy. Cercosporamide and resveratrol exhibited higher binding energy than triac and desipramine and showed the binding energy similar to silychristin. Thus, these compounds could be promising candidates for further evaluation for AHDS prevention. MCT8 deficiency induces severe X-linked psychomotor retardation (Iwayama et al. 2021). It is common and severe in homozygous males (one X chromosome) but mild in heterozygous females (XX) (Dumitrescu et al. 2004). Thyroid normone transporters MCT8 and OATP1C1 are expressed in pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the adult motor cortex of human and macaque brains (Wang et al. 2023). Thyroid hormone transporters MCT8 and OATP1C1 are expressed in projection neurons and interneurons of basal ganglia and motor thalamus in adult human brains (Wang et al. 2023). MCT8 plays a vital role in 
maintaining brain thyroid hormone homeostasis. This transporter is expressed at the brain barriers, as the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), and in neural cells, being the sole known thyroid 
hormone-specific transporter to date. Inactivating mutations in the MCT8
 gene cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) or MCT8 
deficiency, a rare X-linked disease characterized by delayed 
neurodevelopment and severe psychomotor disorders as well as BBB leakage (Guillén-Yunta et al. 2023). A novel SLC16A2 gene mutation produced a rare case of delayed myelination with dysthyroidism, v Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (Mahesan et al. 2023). MCT8 inhibitors include methylmercury, bisphenol-AF and bisphenol-Z as well as previously known MCT8 inhibitors (Wagenaars et al. 2024)."	Animals

Loss of function mutations in MCT8 leads to Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, severe X-linked psychomotor retardation and elevated serum T3 levels (Jansen et al., 2008). Essential molecular determinants for thyroid hormone transport and their structural implications are presented by Kinne et al. (2010). Induced by retinoic acid (Kogai et al., 2010). Mediates energy-independent bidirectional transport. MCT8 is specific for L-iodothyronines and requires at least one iodine atom per aromatic ring. Thyronamines, decarboxylated metabolites of iodothyronines, triiodothyroacetic acid and tetraiodothyroacetic acid, TH derivatives lacking both chiral center and amino group, are not substrates (Kinne et al., 2010). A deficiency causes altered thyroid morphology and a persistent high triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio after thyroidectomy (Wirth et al., 2011). Primary and secondary thyroid hormone transporters have been reviewed (Kinne et al., 2011).

It is present in neurons but not astrocytes where the low affinity MCT1 and MCT4 predominate (Hertz and Dienel 2013). Partially localizes to the peroxysomal membrane (Visser et al. 2007). MCT1 is a negative regulator and MCT2 a positive regulator of osteoclast
 differentiation, while MCT2 is required for bone resorption by 
osteoclasts (Imai et al. 2019). Atorvastatin exerts more selective inhibitory effects on hMCT2 than on hMCT1 and hMCT4 (Yamaguchi et al. 2023)."	Animals
2.A.1.13.6	"Plasma membrane proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter, MCT4 or MCT-4 (SLC16A3). It catalyzes the rapid low affinity plasma membrane transport of many monocarboxylates such as lactate, 
pyruvate, branched-chain oxo acids derived from leucine, valine and 
isoleucine, and the ketone bodies acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and
 acetate.  It is the main transporter that catalyzes lactate efflux from glycolyzing cells (Halestrap 2013; Papakonstantinou et al. 2021).  Residues binding high affinity inhibitors have been identified (Nancolas et al. 2015).  It forms a complex with binding partner, CD147/BSG, which regulates the transport activity (Fisel et al. 2015). It  plays a role in aggressive breast cancer subtypes (Li et al. 2018) as well as other cancers (Park et al. 2018).  MCT4 may be a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer (Kim et al. 2018). MCTs 1 and 4 are present in increased amounts in solid tumors, and inhibitors are potential therapeutics (Puri and Juvale 2020). Anagliptin promotes apoptosis in mouse colon carcinoma cells via MCT-4/lactate-mediated intracellular acidosis (Li et al. 2022). Dietary folate deficiency promotes lactate metabolic disorders that sensitize lung cancer metastasis through mTOR-signaling-mediated targets (Chen et al. 2023). Shikonin reduced MCT4 expression and activation, resulting in inhibition 
of aerobic glycolysis in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and overcoming CAF-induced gemcitabine 
resistance in pancreatic cancer (PC). Shikonin is a promising chemosensitizing phytochemical
 agent when used in combination with gemcitabine for PC treatment. The 
results suggest that disrupting the metabolic coupling between cancer 
cells and stromal cells might provide an attractive strategy for 
improving gemcitabine efficacy (Hu et al. 2024)."	Animals

Also transports glucuronic acid and aspartate. Structure-function studies have identify crucial residues and substrate-induced conformational changes (Courville et al., 2010). Also called SLC17A5. The substrate binding pocket has been identified based on modeling studies (Pietrancosta et al., 2012).  NAAG (N-acetylaspartylglutamate) an abundant neuropeptide in the 
vertebrate nervous system that is released from synaptic terminals in a 
calcium-dependent manner and acts as an agonist at the 
type II metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR3, is transported into synaptic vesicles
 before it is secreted. Lodder-Gadaczek et al. 2013 demonstrate that vesicular uptake
 of NAAG and the related peptide NAAG2 
(N-acetylaspartylglutamylglutamate) is mediated by sialin (SLC17A5). Sialin is probably the only vesicular 
transporter for NAAG and NAAG2, because transport of both peptides was not detectable in vesicles isolated from sialin-deficient mice.  Sialin also transports nitrate in the plasma membrane of salivary glands (Qin et al. 2012). Sialin interacts with nitrate and participates in the regulation of NO production and cell biological functions for body homeostasis (Wang and Qin 2022). Sialin mediates the flux of sialic acid from lysosomes to the cytoplasm (Li et al. 2022). Altered sialin mRNA expression in the main tissues of male type 2 diabetes rats has been documented (Yousefzadeh et al. 2023).  Base editing corrects the common Salla disease SLC17A5 c.115C>T variant (Harb et al. 2023)."

It plays a key role in purinergic signaling through its ability to transport nucleotides using the pmf. It catalyzes Cl--dependent transport activity involving essential arginines in the transmembrane region. Ketoacids inhibit these transporters through modulation of Cl- activation, but Cl- and the arginine residues are not important for ATP binding (Iwai et al. 2019).

2.A.1.16.9	Siderophore iron transporter 3, Str3 of 630 aas and 14 TMSs in a 6 + 7 + 1 TMS arrangement. It transports siderophore iron and so plays a role in iron homeostasis (Pelletier et al. 2003). It also transports heme, and the peroxiredoxin, Tpx1 (Q74887; 192 aas and 0 - 2 possible TMSs), is a binding partner of Str3 (Normant et al. 2020). Under microaerobic conditions, cells deficient in heme biosynthesis and lacking the heme receptor Shu1 exhibit poor hemin-dependent growth in the absence of Tpx1, a cytoplasmic heme binding protein. Tpx1 exhibits an equilibrium constant value of 0.26 muM for hemin. The association of Tpx1 with hemin protects hemin from degradation by H2O2, and the peroxidase activity of hemin is lowered when it is bound to Tpx1 (Normant et al. 2020).

Subtype-specific affinity of rat organic cation transporters rOCT1 and rOCT2
for corticosterone depends on three amino acids within the substrate binding region (Gorboulev et al. 2005). Differences in metformin and thiamine uptake between human and mouse Oct1 transporters have been demonstrated (Meyer et al. 2020)."	Animals
2.A.1.19.10	"The apical proximal tubular kidney/placenta organic anion transporter 4, Oat4 (Slc22a11) (transports estrone sulfate (Km = 1 µM), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (Km = 60µM), many anionic drugs, diuretics, bile salts, urate and ochratoxin A). Catalyzes Na+-independent efflux, possibly using glutamate as a counter anion in an exchange reaction, especially in the placenta (Lofthouse et al. 2015).  Functions in renal urate reabsorption (Prestin et al. 2014). Chlorine decreases the expression of the gene encoding this transporter (Suman et al. 2023). hOAT4 is mainly expressed in the 
kidney and placenta, and is essential for the disposition of numerous drugs,
 toxins, and endogenous substances. It is regulated by insulin-like growth factor and portein kinase B (Yu et al. 2023)."	Animals
2.A.1.19.11	The apical proximal tubular renal urate:anion exchanger, URAT1 (Slc22a12).  Catalyzes Na+-independent anion efflux (secretion) and reabsorption (Eraly et al., 2003a,b; Anzai and Endou, 2011; Prestin et al. 2014)  Regulated by the PDZK1 protein; Anzai et al., 2004). Also transports orotate, a precursor of pyrimidine biosynthesis (Miura et al., 2011). Mutations in URAT1 cause hereditary renal hypouricemia/gaut.  Residues involved in urea and inhibitor binding have been identified (Tan et al. 2016). Mutations can cause renal hypouricemia (RHUC), a heterogeneous genetic disorder that is characterized by decreased serum uric acid concentrations and increased fractional excretion of uric acid (Zhou et al. 2018; Kaynar et al. 2022). Mutation in transmembrane domain 8 of the human urate transporter 1 (residue K393) disrupts uric acid recognition and transport (Lan et al. 2022). Pathogenic variants of SLC22A12 (URAT1) and SLC2A9 (GLUT9) can give rise to renal hypouricemia (Perdomo-Ramirez et al. 2023). Biphenyl carboxylic acid derivatives are potent URAT1 inhibitors (Hou et al. 2023).	Animals

Inhibited by 50 μM benzbromarone, 1 mM probenecid and 10 mM lactate which may also be transported and trans-stimulate urate uptake. May be orthologous to 2.A.1.19.11 as well (Hosoyamada et al., 2004).  Involved in urate absorption across the apical membrane, but probably not the primary route (Eraly et al. 2008; Prestin et al. 2014).

2.A.1.19.15	The liver multispecific organic anion transporter, NLT or OAT2. Transports salicylate, KM=90µM, acetylsalicylate, prostaglandin E2, dicarboxylate, p-aminohippurate, etc. (Sekine et al., 1998)	Animals
2.A.1.19.16	The organic anion transporter, Oat6 or SLC22a20 of 556 aas and 12 TMSs.  Binding and transport rates for 40 anionic substrates have been studied and compared with those for Oat1 (TC# 1.A.1.19.4) (Kaler et al., 2007). Oat6 transports many antiviral agents (Truong et al., 2008). It can bind odorants and is present in the mouse olfactory mucosa; it has been proposed to be an odorant receptor and/or odorant transporter (Wu et al. 2015). Mouse OAT6 is expressed predominantly in olfactory mucosa but not in kidney or brain (Monte et al. 2004).	Animals
2.A.1.19.17	Kidney organic cation transporter-like 3 ORCTL-3 (OAT10; SLC22A13; Like-3) (Bahn et al., 2008) (transports nicotinate, p-aminohippurate and urate; KM=20-40 mμM) via exchange for lactate).  Activated by tumorigeneic mutations in this antitumor gene to promote apoptosis (AbuAli and Grimm 2014).  Functions in urate reabsorption (Prestin et al. 2014).

It is upregulated in polycythemia vera hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Tan and Meier-Abt 2021). It is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (Barton et al., 2005).  Acetylcholine is a physiological substrate, and its transport could be involved in
nonneuronal cholinergic functions (Pochini et al. 2013).  OCTN1 and OCTN2 are associated with several
pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease, primary carnitine deficiency, diabetes,
neurological disorders, and cancer. It transports TEA, and transoirts acetylcholine better than acetylcarnitine (Pochini et al. 2015)."	Animals

2.A.1.19.29	Solute carrier family 22 member 1 (Organic cation transporter 1) (hOCT1).  May be a primary polyamine uptake porter (Abdulhussein and Wallace 2013). Amino acids in TMS1 confer major functional differences between human and mouse orthologs of the polyspecific membrane transporter, OCT1. Reduced function alleles of OCT1 associate significantly with high LDL cholesterol levels (Yee et al. 2023).	Animals
2.A.1.19.3	"The polyspecific organic cation (L- and D-carnitine, butyryl-L-carnitine, acetyl carnitine, γ-butyro-betaine, glycinebetaine, β-lactam antibiotics with a quaternary nitrogen such as cephaloridine, and others):Na+  symporter, OCTN2 (SLC22A5). Carnitine is transporter with high affinity (2 - 20 μM0 (Ingoglia et al. 2015). Associated with Crohn''s disease (Barton et al., 2005) as well as primary carnitine deficiency.  The protein is glycosylated on extracytoplasmic asparagines, and these residues are in a region important for function and turnover (Filippo et al. 2011).  OCTN2 maintains the carnitine homeostasis, resulting from
intestinal absorption, distribution to tissues, and renal excretion/reabsorption (Pochini et al. 2013).  OCTN1 and OCTN2 are associated with several
pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease, primary carnitine deficiency, diabetes,
neurological disorders, and cancer.  OCTN2 is activated in a process dependent on Caveolin1 (Q03135) which interacts directly with OCTN2 and by protein kinase C which does not phosphorylate OCTN2 directly (Czeredys et al. 2013). Cholesterol stimulates the cellular uptake of L-carnitine by the carnitine/organic cation transporter novel 2 (OCTN2) (Zhang et al. 2020). A dataset of OCTN2 variant functions and localization has been created, revealing important 
disease-causing mechanisms (Koleske et al. 2022).  Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is caused by pathogenic variants of the SLC22A5 gene, which encodes a high affinity carnitine transporter. Carnitine is essential for the transport of acyl-CoA, produced from fatty acids, into the mitochondria where they are oxidised to produce energy (Khries et al. 2023). OctN2 transports doxorubicin (Yi et al. 2023). A novel pathogenic variant in the carnitine 
transporter gene, SLC22A5, is associated with metabolic carnitine 
deficiency and cardiomyopathy features (Jolfayi et al. 2024)."	Animals
2.A.1.19.30	"Solute carrier family 22 member 2 (Organic cation transporter 2) (hOCT2).  Oct2 is a low affinity high efficiency choline transporter, enriched in synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons (Nakata et al. 2013).  May also transport peptides and peptide derivatives (Volková et al. 2015). It also transports L-carnitine (Adeva-Andany et al. 2017). OCT2 is a multispecific transporter with cholesterol-dependent allosteric features. The role of cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus sequences (CRAC and CARC) in the allosteric binding to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) has been reported (Sutter et al. 2021). Comparisons of the inhibitory potential of elacridar and imazalil on 
metformin uptake with that on MPP uptake revealed substrate-dependent 
differences in hOCT2 and mOct2 for both inhibitors (Kuehne et al. 2022)."	Animals
2.A.1.19.31	Solute carrier family 22 member 6 (Organic anion transporter 1) (hOAT1) (PAH transporter) (hPAHT) (Renal organic anion transporter 1) (hROAT1),  Probably orthologous to 2.A.1.19.4. Functions in urate uptake from the circulation across the basolateral membrane of tubular cells (Prestin et al. 2014).  It transports methotrexate (anticancer), acyclovir (antiviral), and adefovir (antiviral) (Nigam 2015).	Animals
2.A.1.19.32	"Solute carrier family 22 member 15 (Fly-like putative transporter 1) (Flipt 1). This system is required for hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis (Fang et al. 2021). SLC22A15 (FLIPT1) prefers zwitterionic compounds over cations and anions. Eight zwitterions transported include ergothioneine, carnitine, 
carnosine, gabapentin, as well as four cations including MPP+ , thiamine and cimetidine. Carnosine was a 
specific substrate of SLC22A15 among the transporters in the SLC22A 
family. SLC22A15 transport was sodium-dependent 
and exhibited higher Km values for ergothioneine, carnitine, and carnosine 
compared to previously identified transporters for these ligands (Yee et al. 2020). Many carnitine derivatives (i.e., (R)-3-hydrixybutryl carnitine, hexanoyl carnitine and glutaryl carnitine amoung others) are also transported."	Animals
2.A.1.19.33	Solute carrier family 22 member 25 (Organic anion transporter UST6).  Expressed exclusively in liver in both embryo and adult (Eraly et al. 2004). It may take up a nucleobase-containing compound (Meixner et al. 2020).	Animals

A 3-dimensional model of OAT1 has led to the identification of residues involved in differential transport of substrates such as p-aminohippurate and cidofovir (Perry et al., 2006). Oat1 transports many antiviral agents (Truong et al., 2008).  The human orthologue (Q4U2R8; 563aas) has been shown to be a multispecific organic anion transporter on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule in human kidney (Hosoyamada et al. 1999). A substrate binding hinge domain is required for transport-related structural changes (Egenberger et al., 2012). Transports environmental toxins and clinically important drugs including anti-HIV therapeutics, anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-inflammatories (Duan et al., 2011). hOAT1 has two GXXXG motifs in TMSs 2 and 5 which play critical roles in stability (Duan et al., 2011).  Both OAT1 and OAT3 of humans are inhibited by caffeic acid (Ki ~ 17 μM) (Uwai et al. 2011).

Animals
2.A.1.19.8	"The human organic cation transporter, SLC22A17.  The rat orthologue may be inactive (Bennett et al. 2011). It is also the cell surface receptor for Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) that plays a key role in iron 
homeostasis and transport. It is able to bind iron-LCN2, 
followed by internalization and release of iron, thereby 
increasing intracellular iron concentration and leading to inhibition of
 apoptosis (Cabedo Martinez et al. 2016). It also binds iron-free LCN2, followed by 
internalization and its association with an intracellular 
siderophore, leading to iron chelation and iron transfer to the 
extracellular medium, thereby reducing intracellular iron concentrations
and resulting in apoptosis.  The SLC22A17/lipocalin-2 receptor plays a role in renal endocytosis of proteins involved in metalloproteins, particularly on iron- and cadmium-binding proteins (Thévenod et al. 2023).  Other renal functions of SLC22A17 include its contribution to osmotic stress adaptation, protection against urinary tract infection, and renal carcinogenesis."

2.A.1.2.102	TetA class C (TetA(C)) of 396 aas and 12 TMSs. The TetA(C) of the transposon, Tn10, not only exports tetracycline by a proton antiport mechanism, it also increases susceptibility to cadmium, fusaric acid, bleomycin and  several classes of cationic aminoglycoside antibiotics (Griffith et al. 1995).  For this reason, it has been used to generate dual counter selection procedures (Li et al. 2013). It is not certain that this is due to import of these compounds as this increased susceptibility could be due to a secondary effect.	TetA(C) of E. coli

2.A.1.2.104	"MFS carrier of 490 aas and 12 TMSs, MfsD14a or Hiat1 (Hippocampus abundant transcript 1 protein) is a member of the SLC18 family.  It is 76% identical to 2.A.1.2.30. Mutant mice (Mus musculus, strain 129S6Sv/Ev) were generated with the Mfsd14a gene disrupted with a LacZ reporter gene. Mutant mice are viable and healthy, but males are sterile due to a 100-fold reduction in the number of spermatozoa in the vas deferens. Male mice have adequate levels of testosterone and show normal copulatory behaviour. The few spermatozoa that are formed show rounded head defects similar to those found in humans with globozoospermia. Spermatogenesis proceeds normally up to the round spermatid stage, but the subsequent structural changes associated with spermiogenesis are severely disrupted with failure of acrosome formation, sperm head condensation and mitochondrial localization to the mid-piece of the sperm. Mfsd14a expression occurs in Sertoli cells, suggesting that MFSD14A may transport a solute from the bloodstream that is required for spermiogenesis (Doran et al. 2016). MFSD14A and MFSD14B are intracellular neuronal membrane-bound proteins,
 expressed in the Golgi and ER, and their levels of expression are affected by both 
starvation and a high fat diet to varying degrees in the mouse brain (Lekholm et al. 2017). It is associated with milk production in buffalo and sheep 
breeds, as well as growth of chickens and goats, and drastically affect s
sperm morphogenesis (Luo et al. 2023). The functional InDel polymorphism (rs1089950828) reflects growth traits in domestic sheep populations (Luo et al. 2023)."	MfsD14a of Homo sapiens

activated in response to this herbicide. Tpo1p is required to reduce the intracellular concentration of 
2,4-D (Cabrito et al. 2009). K+ may be its physiological substrate, and it may play a dual role in polar auxin transport and drought stress tolerance (Remy et al. 2013). It is also involved in auxin efflux and acts as a positive 
regulator of shootward transport at the root apex. Possibly, it may mediate proton 
efflux from the vacuolar compartment (Remy et al. 2013)."	Tpo1 of Arabidopsis thaliana

activity and higher fluconazole susceptibility when assessed as a 
biofilm. The mutant also showed decreased metabolic activity during 
biofilm formation and grew more slowly under 
neutral-basic pH conditions. The qdr2 deletion in C. glabrata resulted in
 an impaired ability to maintain pH homeostasis, which led in turn to a 
reduction of cell growth and of adherence to an artificial matrix (Widiasih Widiyanto et al. 2019). Mitochondrion-targeted antifungal drugs have been reviewed (Qin et al. 2023)."	MDR pump of Candida glabrata (Yeast) (Torulopsis glabrata)

Can function as a Na+  (K+)/H+  antiporter (Lewinson and Bibi 2001; Higgins, 2007). Is known to provide resistance to a wide variety of dissimilar toxic compounds, including neutral, cationic and zwitterionic substances.  Crystals that diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution and belonged to the hexagonal space group P6122 have been obtained (Nagarathinam et al. 2017). For review of MdfA see Lewinson et al., 2006. The conformational switch accompanying transport is induced by the promiscuous binding of substrates and/or inhibitors to the binding pocket (Fluman et al., 2009). MdfA normally extrudes monovalent cationic drugs in exchange for a single proton, but it transports divalent cationic drugs poorly. It can be mutated to antiport a divalent cationic drug for 2 protons (Tirosh et al., 2012). Transporters acting across the inner and outer membranes have synergistic effects with each other, but transporters acting across the same membrane are usually additive but can be synergistic under special circumstances, owing to a bifurcation controlled by the barrier constant (Saha et al. 2020). Promiscuity in the geometry of electrostatic interactions between  MdfA and cationic substrates has been demonstrated (Adler and Bibi 2005). With respect to ethidium bromide, the inner membrane transporter MdfA is synergistic to the TolC-dependent efflux across the outer membrane (Saha et al. 2020). The conformational behavior of MdfA in response to substrate binding has been studied (Bahrenberg et al. 2021). Overexpression of the gene for MdfA allows export of Lacto-N-triose (LNT II) and lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), human milk oligosaccharides (Sugita and Koketsu 2022).	Bacteria

2.A.1.2.29	"The vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2 (pumps dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine into synaptic vesicles) (Cliburn et al. 2016). VMAT2 physically and functionally interacts with the enzymes responsible for dopamine synthesis (Cartier et al., 2010).  Molecular hinge points mediating alternating access have been identified (Yaffe et al. 2013). The substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 
ecstasy), is a widely used drug of abuse that induces non-exocytotic 
release of serotonin, dopamine,

MFSD14A (HIAT1) and MFSD14B (HIATL1) are in the mouse central nervous system throughout the adult brain (Lekholm et al. 2017). Expression of SLC22A18 regulates oxaliplatin resistance (Kim et al. 2022), and in cases of oxaliplatin resistance due to low SLC22A18 expression, 
resistance can be overcome by treatment with an ERK inhibitor (Kim et al. 2022). Two ammonia transporters, HIAT1alpha and HIAT1beta, in the American Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus, have been identified and characterized (Sachs et al. 2022). This gene is associated with milk production in buffalo and sheep breeds, as well as growth of chickens and goats, and drastically affect sperm formation (Luo et al. 2023).

2.A.1.2.5	"Multidrug (14- and 15-membered macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, tetracyclines, daunomycin, ethidium bromide, etc.):H+ antiporter, LmrP.  Two proton translocation pathways have been proposed (Bapna et al., 2007), but Schaedler and van Veen, 2010 have provided evidence that a flexible cation binding site in LmrP is associated with variable proton coupling. Basic residues R260 and K357 affect the conformational dynamics of LmrP (Wang and van Veen, 2012).  Basic residues, R260 and K357 control the conformational dynamics of the protein (Wang and van Veen 2012).  Also specifically catalyzes Ca2+:3H+ antiport with an affinity of 7 μM (Zhang et al. 2012). Two carboxylates (Asp-235 and Glu-327) are critical for Ca2+ binding.  Protonation drives major conformational switches (Masureel et al. 2013). The system exhibits plasticity in proton interactions, which is a consequence of the
flexibility in the location of key residues that are responsible for proton/multidrug antiport (Nair et al. 2016)."	Gram-positive bacteria

2.A.1.2.51	Chloramphenicol resistance pump, CraA (43% identical to MdfA of E. coli) (Roca et al., 2009). It is a broad specificity transporter exporting chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, florfenicol, ethidium, dequalinium, chlorhexidine, benzalkonium, mitomycin C and TPP+. Glu-38 is essential for activity (Foong et al. 2019).	Bacteria
2.A.1.2.52	Puromycin resistance MDR protein, MdtM (Soo et al., 2011).  Also catalyzes bile salt:H+ antiport, and binds cholate and deoxycholate to the protein with micromolar affinity. Functions as an MDR pump (Nishino and Yamaguchi 2001). Acts synergistically with AcrAB-TolC (Paul et al. 2014). The ortholog has been characterized in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and specific residues have been shown to be important for transport and stability (Shaheen et al. 2021).	Bacteria

2.A.1.2.55	Peptide exporter (Ala-Gln and Ala-branched chain amino and dipeptides) (Hayashi et al., 2010).  May also export arabinose (but not xylose) and function as an MDR pump (Koita and Rao 2012).	Bacteria
2.A.1.2.56	NCL7 or MFSD8. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, NCL, a neuro-degenerative genetic disease, is caused by mutations in at least 8 different human genes, one of which, CLN7 (MFSD8), is associated with late infantile NCL. CLN7 is localized to lysosomes (Sharifi et al., 2010).  Loss of this putative lysosomal transporter in the brain leads to lysosomal dysfunction, impaired constitutive autophagy and neurodegeneration late in the disease (Brandenstein et al. 2015). An in-frame deletion in the MFSD8 gene gave rise to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (Hosseini Bereshneh and Garshasbi 2018). In D. discoideum, it interacts with cathepsin D (CtsD), as well as human orthologs of CLN3 (Cln3) and CLN5 (Cln5) (Huber et al. 2020). In humans the defect can also affect cardiac conducting cells and cardiomyocytes as well as basophilic degeneration of myocardium. (Iannaccone Farkašová et al. 2019).  Moreover, loss of Mfsd8 alters the secretome during Dictyostelium aggregation (Huber et al. 2023).	Animals
2.A.1.2.57	"MFS-type polyamine transporter SLC18B1 or VPAT (Solute carrier family 18 member B1) of 456 aas and 12 TMSs.  Polyamines synthesized in neurons and astrocytes are stored in secretory
 vesicles and released upon depolarization. Vesicular storage 
is mediated in an ATP-dependent, reserpine-sensitive process.  SLC18B1 is the fourth member of the SLC18 transporter family, which includes 
vesicular monoamine transporters and a vesicular acetylcholine 
transporter. Proteoliposomes containing purified human SLC18B1 protein actively transport spermine and spermidine in exchange of H+. The SLC18B1 protein is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and is associated with vesicles in astrocytes. SLC18B1 gene knockdown decreased both the amount of the SLC18B1 protein and the spermine/spermidine contents of astrocytes (Hiasa et al. 2014).  Slc18b1 knock out mice have reduced polyamine content in the brain These mice have impaired short and long term 
memory in novel object recognition, radial arm maze and 
self-administration paradigms (Fredriksson et al. 2019). Moreover, Slc18b1 KO mice have 
altered expression of genes involved in Long Term Potentiation, 
plasticity, calcium signalling and synaptic functions, and expression of components of GABA and glutamate signalling are alterred. These mutants show partial resistance to diazepam, manifested as lowered reduction in locomotion after diazepam treatment. 
Possibly, removal of Slc18b1 leads to reduction of polyamine 
contents in neurons, resulting in reduced GABA signalling due to 
a long-term reduction in glutamatergic signalling (Fredriksson et al. 2019).  Polyamine release and vesicular polyamine transporter, SLC18B1; VPAT,. expression in megakaryoblastic cells and plateletshas been documented (Uehara et al. 2024)."	Animals

2.A.1.2.6	(Benomyl, cycloheximide, methotrexate, fluconazole, etc.):H+ antiporter, CaMDR1 (Basso et al., 2010; Cannon et al., 1998). MDR1 catalyzes efflux of commonly used azoles. The central cytoplasmic loop is critical for MDR function, but does not impart substrate specificity (Mandal et al., 2012). The structural basis for polyspecificity of MDR MFS transporters, based on studies with Mdr1, is the extended capacity brought by residues located at the periphery of a binding core to accomodate compounds differing in size and type (Redhu et al. 2018). Each domain in the protein is arranged in a pseudo-symmetric fold of two tandems of 3-TMSs that alternatly expose the drug-binding site towards the inside or the outside of the yeast to promote drug binding and release. Sharma et al. 2022 provided information on these motifs by having screened a library of 64 drug transport-deficient mutants and their corresponding suppressors spontaneously addressing the deficiency. They found that five strains recovered the drug-resistance capacity by expressing CaMdr1 with a secondary mutation. The pairs of debilitating/rescuing residues are distributed either in the same TMS or 3-TMS repeat, at the hinge of 3-TMS repeat tandems, and between the N- and C-domains. Most of these mutants belong to different signature motifs, highlighting a mechanistic role and interplay thought to be conserved among MFS proteins. Results point to the specific role of TMS 11 in the interplay between the N- and C-domains in the inward- to outward-open conformational transition (Sharma et al. 2022).	Yeast
2.A.1.2.60	YajR of 454 aas and 12 TMSs.  The 3-D structure in the outward-facing conformation is available at 3.15Å resolution, and the cytoplasmic C-terminal YAM domain has been solved to 1.07Å resolution.  This 65 aa YAM domain is thought to control the conformational states of the protein (Jiang et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2014).	Proteobacteria
2.A.1.2.61	"SPX domain-containing membrane protein At1g63010, called Vacuolar Phosphate Transporter 1 (VPT1), It transports phosphate > sulphate > nitrate > chloride and malate.  The vpt1 mutant plants were stunted and consistently 
retained less Pi than wild type plants, especially when grown in medium 
containing high levels of Pi. In seedlings, VPT1 was expressed primarily
 in younger tissues under normal conditions, but was strongly induced by
 high-Pi conditions in older tissues, suggesting that VPT1 functions in 
Pi storage in young tissues and in detoxification of high Pi in older 
tissues. As a result, disruption of VPT1 rendered plants hypersensitive 
to both low-Pi and high-Pi conditions, reducing the adaptability of 
plants to changing Pi availability (Liu et al. 2015)."	Plants
2.A.1.2.62	Putative MDR pump, YdhC or PunC.  It has been reporte to export arabinose but not xylose (Koita and Rao 2012). However, it also takes up adenosine, adenine, deoxyadenosine, and other purine nucleosides and nucleobases such as inosine and guanosine as sole nitrogen sources. It also takes up various sulfonamides such as sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole.  Expression of the punC gene is reglulated by the positive transcription factor, PunR (YdhB) (Rodionova et al. 2021).

Iannelli et al. 2018 suggested that MefA can function with an ATPase, MsrD (TC# 3.A.1.121.6), and therefore function as an ABC drug exporter.  However, the data presented seem inconsistent with this suggestion. The two genes encoding these two proteins are adjacent to each other, suggesting that they may function together (Iannelli et al. 2018). Predicted transmembrane proteins with homology to MefA do not complement a mefA deletion in the MefA-MsrD macrolide efflux system in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Fox et al. 2021). Note: MsrD is an ATPase of the ABC superfamily, so it can not be certain that MefA and MsrD function together. Coupling of an MFS carrier with an ABC-type energizer is very rare, maybe non-existent.

2.A.1.22.1	"Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine) transporter, SV2A or SLC22B1.  This protein localizes to neurotransmitter-containing vesicles and has a nucleotide binding site (Yao and Bajjalieh 2009). The SV2 family is comprised of three 
paralogues: SV2A, SV2B, and SV2C. They are present in secretory vesicles, including 
synaptic vesicles, and are critical to neurotransmission. Structural and
 functional studies suggest that SV2 proteins may play several roles to 
promote proper vesicular function. Among these roles are their potential
 to stabilize the transmitter content of vesicles, to maintain and 
orient the releasable pool of vesicles, and to regulate vesicular 
calcium sensitivity to ensure efficient, coordinated release of the 
transmitter (Stout et al. 2019). SV2A plays a role in neuronal excitability and as
 such is the specific target for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam as well as seletracetam and brivaracetam. 
SV2 proteins also act as the target by which potent neurotoxins, 
particularly botulinum, gain access to neurons and exert their toxicity.
 Both SV2B and SV2C are increasingly implicated in diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite 
decades of intensive research, their exact functions were elusive in 2019 (Stout et al. 2019), but the systems may transport galactose.The human (Q70J3) and rat orthologs are 99% identical. The structure, function, and disease relevance of GP2 (SV2) transporters have been reviewed (Stout et al. 2019).  More than one percent of people have epilepsy worldwide. Levetiracetam 
(LEV) is a successful new-generation antiepileptic drug (AED), and its 
derivative, brivaracetam (BRV), shows improved efficacy. Synaptic 
vesicle glycoprotein 2a (SV2A), a membrane transporter in the 
synaptic vesicles (SVs), has been identified as a target of LEV and BRV.
 SV2A also serves as a receptor for botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) (Yamagata et al. 2024).  The structural basis for antiepileptic drugs and botulinum neurotoxin recognition of SV2A have been ellucidated (Yamagata et al. 2024)."	Animals

2.A.1.22.6	Synaptic vesicle 2C, SV2C or SLC22B3, of 727 aas and 11 TMSs. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit neurotransmitter release by selectively cleaving core components of the vesicular fusion machinery. The synaptic vesicle proteins Synaptotagmin-I and -II act as receptors for BoNT/B and BoNT/G. Mahrhold et al. 2006 showed that BoNT/A also interacts with a synaptic vesicle protein, the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C), but not with the homologous proteins SV2A and SV2B. Binding of BoNT/A occurs at the membrane juxtaposed region preceding transmembrane domain 8. A peptide comprising the intravesicular domain between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 specifically reduces the neurotoxicity of BoNT/A at phrenic nerve preparations, demonstrating the physiological relevance of this interaction (Mahrhold et al. 2006). The interactions of SV2C with BoNT have been reviewed (Li et al. 2020). SV2C is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Stout et al. 2019). It seems to play roles in vesicle trafficking, exocytosis and neurotransmission (Hu et al. 2017).	SV2C of Homo sapiens

The AmpG permease is also required for AmpC beta-lactamase induction (Chahboune et al. 2005; Park and Uehara 2008). AmpG mediates a dynamic relationship between serine beta-lactamase induction and biofilm-formation (Mallik et al. 2018).	Bacteria

2.A.1.28.1	Cell surface receptor (C-receptor) for anemia-inducing feline leukemia virus subgroup C (FLCVR, Slc49A1 or Mfsd7d) of 555 aas and 12 TMSs. It may function in choline transport (Kenny et al. 2023) or haem export in haemopoietic cells (Latunde-Dada et al., 2006; Khan and Quigley, 2011) and may cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia when defective (Keel et al., 2008). Mutations of FLVCR1 in posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa result in the loss of heme export activity (Yanatori et al., 2012). Heme accumulation causes toxicity (Khan and Quigley 2018).  FLVCR1 is co-induced upon iron insufficiency in the placenta with the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) heme receptor, and these two proteins may be important for neonatal iron status (Cao et al. 2014).  FLVCR1 is required for erythroid and αβ-, CD4 and CD8 T- cell development (Philip et al. 2015). A splice-site variant of FLVCR1 produces retinitis pigmentosa without posterior column ataxia (Yusuf et al. 2018). Protocols suitable for purification of FLVCR1a, antibody generation and structural characterization of the transporter have been reported (Chiabrando et al. 2020). FLVCR1-related disease is a rare cause of retinitis pigmentosa and hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (Grudzinska Pechhacker et al. 2020). More recently, integrative genetic analyses identified FLVCR1 as a plasma-membrane choline transporter in mammals (Kenny et al. 2023).	Animals

2.A.1.3.22	The Tet38 tetracycline-resistance protein of 450 aas and 14  TMSs of S. aureus (Truong-Bolduc et al., 2005). Tet38 has distinct functions, including drug efflux and host cell attachment and internalization mediated by interaction with host cell CD36. Truong-Bolduc et al. 2021 identified key amino acids involved in different functions. Cysteine substitutions of arginine 106, situated at the junction of TMS 4 and external loop L2, and glycine 151 of motif C on TMS 5, resulted in 8- to 16-fold reductions in Tet38-mediated resistance to tetracycline, with minimal effect on A549 host cell internalization. In contrast, two three-amino-acid deletions, F411P412G413, in external loop L7, situated between TMSs 13 and 14, and D38D39L40, in external loop L1, situated between TMS 1 and 2, led to decreased tetracycline resistance, but only the former affected S. aureus internalization and impaired binding to CD36 (Truong-Bolduc et al. 2021).

2.A.1.3.34	The P55 (MFS55) triglyceride (TAG)/drug efflux pump (Rv141Oc) (extrudes drugs including rifampicin and clifazimine, first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.) CCCP and valinomycin inhibited drug resistance (Ramón-García et al., 2009).  P55 also exports malachite green, ethidium bromide, isoniazid and ethambutol (Bianco et al. 2011).  It functions together with the outer membrane lipoprotein porin, LprG (P9WK45; TC# 9.B.138.1.1), also called P27 and Lpp-27 (Bianco et al. 2011; Farrow and Rubin 2008).  MFS55 is required together with LprG for normal colony morphology and sliding motility, possibly due to alterred cell wall composition (Farrow and Rubin 2008). MFS transporter Rv1410 and the periplasmic lipoprotein, LprG, transport triacylglycerides (TAGs) that seal the mycomembrane. Remm et al. 2023 reported a 2.7 Å structure of a mycobacterial Rv1410 homologue, which adopts an outward-facing conformation and exhibits unusual transmembrane helix 11 and 12 extensions that protrude ~20 Å into the periplasm. A small, very hydrophobic cavity suitable for lipid transport is constricted by a functionally important ion-lock likely involved in proton coupling. Combining mutational analyses and MD simulations, the authors proposed that TAGs are extracted from the core of the inner membrane into the central cavity via lateral clefts present in the inward-facing conformation. The functional role of the periplasmic helix extensions is to channel the extracted TAG into the lipid binding pocket of LprG (Remm et al. 2023).	Bacteria
2.A.1.3.36	EmrKY-TolC MDR efflux pump (Nishino and Yamaguchi 2001). (also exports cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006)) (similar to 2.A.1.3.2)	Bacteria

2.A.1.3.4	(Mono- and divalent organocation):H+ antiporter. Transmembrane helix 12 of QacA lines the bivalent cationic drug binding pocket (Hassan et al., 2007). Two sites, D34 and D411 are involved in substrate recognition, while E407 facilitates substrate efflux as a protonation site and plays a role as a substrate recognition site for the transport of dequalinium, a divalent quaternary ammonium compound (Majumder et al. 2019). TMS 12 and its external flanking loop are required for the structural and functional integrity of QacA, and they contain amino acids directly involved in their interactions with substrates (Dashtbani-Roozbehani et al. 2023). Cryo-EM structures of QacA from S. aureus revealed a novel extracellular loop with an allosteric role (Majumder et al. 2023).	Gram-positive bacteria
2.A.1.3.40	The phenazine resistance pump. It also exports D-alanyl-griseoluteic acid; possibly in conjunction with a chaperone protein, EhpR. The crystal structure of EhpR is known (Yu et al., 2011). Note: Phenazines are toxic redox active secondary metabolites that many bacteria secrete. It may be  involved in the export of griseoluteic acid, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the broad-spectrum phenazine antibiotic, D-alanylgriseoluteic acid (Dagher et al. 2021).	Bacteria

2.A.1.3.48	Multidrug-efflux transporter Rv1634/MT1670 of 471 aas and 14 TMSs.  Both Rv1634 and Rv1258c are believed to play a major role in drug resistance by altering the protein pump that is required to remove the active drug compounds from the bacterial cell (Panja et al. 2019). Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are substrates, to which M. tuberculosis strains have become resistant. The expulsion of the drugs to the outside the bacterial cell occurs through the alternating-access mechanism of N and C-terminal domains (Singh and Akhter 2021).	Bacteria

Resistance to puromycin, tosofloxacin, norfloxacin, acriflavin, ethidium, and tetraphenyl phosphonium, but not ofloxacin, nalidixic acid or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Ohki and Murata 1997). A spontaneous B. subtilis mutant isolated in the presence of a high concentration of
 puromycin acquired a multidrug-resistant phenotype due to high level expression of the bmr3 gene (Ohki and Tateno 2004), and selection for improved synthesis of menaquinone-7 also caused increased expression (Cui et al. 2020)."	Bacilli

2.A.1.3.59	MDR efflux pump, NorC (Truong-Bolduc et al. 2006). Proposed to be a quinolone resistance exporter, NorB (Marklevitz and Harris 2016). The 3-d x-ray structure at 3.6 Å resolution has been solved in an outward open configuration (Kumar et al. 2021). The structure shows that NorC specifically interacts with an organic cation, tetraphenylphosphonium.

2.A.1.3.84	Trichothecene efflux pump, Tri12, of 590 aas and 14 TMSs (Lee et al. 2002). It may function as a phospholipid flippase, and five flippases (FgDnfA, B, C1, C2 and D have been identified  (Yun et al. 2020). FgDnfA is critical for normal vegetative growth while the other flippases are dispensable. FgDnfA and FgDnfD are crucial for fungal pathogenesis, and a remarkable reduction in deoxynivalenol (DON) production was observed in DeltaFgDNFA and DeltaFgDNFD strains. Deletion of the FgDNFB gene increased DON production to about 30 fold. FgDnfA and FgDnfD play positive roles in the regulation of trichothecene (TRI) gene (TRI1, TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, TRI12, and TRI101) expression and toxisome reorganization, while FgDnfB acts as a negative regulator of DON synthesis. FgDnfB and FgDnfD have redundant functions in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine transport, and double deletion of FgDNFB and FgDnfD showed defects in fungal development, DON synthesis, and virulence. Thus, the distinct and specific functions of flippase family members in F. graminearum have been determined, and FgDnfA, FgDnfD, and FgDnfB have specific spatiotemporal roles during toxisome biogenesis (Yun et al. 2020). This protein is 76% identical to the protein with TC# 2.A.1.3.47, and they probably catalyze the same reaction(s).	Tri12 of Gibberella zeae (Wheat head blight fungus) (Fusarium graminearum)

levels of the YfmO efflux pump, YfmO could catalyze copper efflux and be 
responsible for reduced copZA induction. Consistent with this model, a yfmP yfmO double mutant showed normal induction by copper (Gaballa et al. 2003)."	Bacilli

2.A.1.42.1	"The lysophospholipid (LPL) transporter, LplT (Harvat et al., 2005).  Substrates include lyso-PE, lyso-cardiolipin, diacylcardiolipin, fully-deacylated cardiolipin and lyso-phosphatidylglycerol, but not lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic acid or phosphatidic acid (Lin et al. 2016). Reacylation by acyltransferase/acyl-acyl 
carrier protein synthetase then occurs on the inner leaflet of the membrane.Thus, a fatty acid chain is not required for LplT 
transport. A ""sideways sliding"" 
mechanism was proposed to explain how a conserved membrane-embedded α-helical 
interface excludes diacylphospholipids from the LplT binding site to 
facilitate efficient flipping of lysophospho-lipids across the cell 
membrane (Lin et al. 2016). Thus, a fatty acid chain is not required for LplT 
transport. Fruther, LplT cannot transport lysophosphatidic acid, 
and its substrate binding was not inhibited by either orthophosphate or 
glycerol 3-phosphate, indicating that either a glycerol or ethanolamine 
headgroup is the chemical determinant for substrate recognition. Diacyl 
forms of PE, phosphatidylglycerol, or the tetra-acylated form of 
cardiolipin could not serve as competitive inhibitors .A ""sideways sliding"" 
mechanism was proposed to explain how a conserved membrane-embedded α-helical 
interface can exclude diacylphospholipids from the LplT binding site. A dual substrate-accessing mechanism, in which LplT recruits LPLs to its substrate-binding site via two routes, either from its extracellular entry site, or through a membrane-embedded groove between transmembrane helices, and it then moves them towards the inner membrane leaflet (Lin et al. 2018)."

It is a spingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (or sphingolipid) exporter (Nijnik et al. 2012). S1P is important for lymphocyte trafficking, immune responses, 
vascular and embryonic development, cancer, bone homeostasis (Zhu et al. 2018). S1P 
is produced intracellularly and then secreted into the circulation to 
engage in the above physiological or pathological processes by 
regulating the proliferation, differentiation and survival of target 
cells. SPNS2 acts as a mediator of 
intracellular S1P release. The SPNS1-dependent lysosomal lipid transport pathway enables cell survival under choline limitation (Scharenberg et al. 2023). The orphan lysosomal transmembrane protein SPNS1 is critical for cell survival under choline limitation. SPNS1 loss leads to intralysosomal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). SPNS1 is a proton gradient-dependent transporter of LPC species from the lysosome for their re-esterification into phosphatidylcholine in the cytosol (Scharenberg et al. 2023)."	Animals

2.A.1.5.1	"β- and α-galactopyranoside:H+ symporter, LacY. Transports
lactose, melibiose, thio-β-methyl galactopyranoside (TMG), isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG), 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and galactopyranosyl-1-glycerol. Single point mutations allow transport of sucrose and maltose (King and Wilson 1990).  Crystal structures and modeling reveal the
cytoplasmic open state and the periplasmic open state (PDB ID: 1PV7). A structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, revealed the sugar-binding site in a cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation were identified (Abramson et al., 2003; Pendse et al., 2010). The
membrane lipid composition determines the topology of LacY (Dowhan and
Bogdanov, 2011). Smirnova et al. (2011) have
provided evidence that the opening of the periplasmic cavity in LacY is the
limiting step for sugar binding. Evidence for an alternating sites mechanism of
transport has been summarized (Smirnova et al., 2011). Eames
and Kortemme (2012) have shown that when
considering expression of the lac operon, LacY function (H+ co-transport)
and not protein production is the primary origin of cost fitness. Homology
threading of several MFS porters based on the LacY 3-d structure has been
reported (Kasho et al., 2006). The
alternating-access mechanism has been suggested to arise from inverted
topological repeats (Radestock and Forrest, 2011; Madej et al. 2012), but
this proposal has been contested (Västermark and Saier 2014; Västermark et al. 2014).
Mechanistic features of LacY have been summarized (Kaback 2015). Insertion into the membrane depends on YidC (TC# 2.A.9.3.1) and may occur in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process (Serdiuk et al. 2017). The glucose Enzyme IIA (Crr) protein binds LacY to allosterically inhibit its activity, promoting inducer exclusion (Hoischen et al. 1996; Hariharan et al. 2015). Protonated LacY binds D-galactopyranosides specifically, inducing an 
occluded state that can open to either side of the membrane (Kumar et al. 2014). LacY can form amyloid-like fibrils under destabilizing conditions (Stroobants et al. 2017). Multiple conformations of LacY have been solved (Kumar et al. 2018).  Direct interactions between LacY and its lipid environment uniquely contribute to its membrane protein organization and function (Vitrac et al. 2020). The lactose permease purified from E. coli exhibiting varied phospholipid compositions has the same topology and function as in its membrane of origin (Vitrac et al. 2019)."	Bacteria

2.A.1.50.1	"The apical intestinal and choroid plexus proton-coupled, high affinity folate transporter, the hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) protein, PCFT/HCP1 (Shin et al. 2010).  Also reported to mediate heme-iron uptake from the gut lumen with duodenal epithelial cells (Shayeghi et al., 2005; Latunde-Dada et al., 2006; Subramanian et al., 2008, Shin et al., 2012b), but it shows a higher affinity for folate than heme) (Qiu et al., 2006). Responsible for folate uptake by choroid plexus epithelial cells (Wollack et al., 2007) and placenta (Yasuda et al., 2008). The rat orthologue (Q5EBA8) catalyzes H+-dependent folate uptake in the intestine (Inoue et al., 2008; Zhao and Goldman, 2007; Qiu et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2012). Evidence for a 12 TMS topology with a renetrant loop between TMSs 2 and 3 has been presented (Zhao et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2011; Wilson et al. 2014).  Downregulated in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in heart, liver, and brain, causing malabsorption (Bukhari et al., 2011). An IGXXG motif in TMS5 is important for folate binding and a GXXXG motif is involved in dimerization (Zhao et al., 2012). It is inhibited by bicarbonate, bisulfite, nitrite and other anions (Zhao et al. 2013).  Its role in antifolate cancer chemotherapy has been reviewed (Matherly et al. 2014). TMSs 3
and 6 may provide critical interfaces for formation of hPCFT oligomers, facilitated by
the GXXXG motifs in TMS2 and TMS4 (Wilson et al. 2015).  The extracellular gate has been identified (Zhao et al. 2016), and mechanistic aspects have been considered (Date et al. 2016). Residues in the seventh and eighth TMSs play roles in the translocation pathway and folate binding (Aluri et al. 2017). The mutation, N411K-PCFT, is responsible for HFM (Aluri et al. 2018). PCFT is ubiquitously expressed in solid tumors to which it delivers antifolates, particularly pemetrexed, into cancer cells in a concentrative fashion (Zhao et al. 2018). Substitutions have been identified that lock and unlock PCFT into an inward-open conformation (Aluri et al. 2019). The nanodisc lipid composition influences the cell-free expression of PCFT (Do et al. 2021). Iron deficiency promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, and the loss of SLC46A1 expression leads to iron deficiency in liver tumor tissues (Wang et al. 2022). Cell-free expression of PCFT in the presence of nanodiscs has been reported (Do and Jansen 2022). Biological and therapeutic applications of the proton-coupled folate transporter have been reviewed (Matherly et al. 2022)."	Animals

2.A.1.53.3	The MFSD1 (SMAP4) transporter (465 aas; 12 TMSs).  Expression is increased in mice by amino acid starvation and decreased by a high fat diet (Perland et al. 2016). This lysosomal transporter is essential for liver homeostasis and critically depends on its accessory subunit GLMP (Massa López et al. 2019). MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated but contains a dileucine-based sorting motif needed for its transport to lysosomes. Mfsd1 knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. GLMP (406 aas and at least 2 TMSs, N- and C-terminal) physically interacts with MFSD1 and is a critical accessory subunit. GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. Glmp knockout mice mimic the phenotype of Mfsd1 knockout mice (Massa López et al. 2019).  The two lysosomal integral membrane proteins MFSD1 and GLMP form a tight complex that confers protection of both interaction partners against lysosomal proteolysis. López et al. 2020 refined the molecular interaction of the two proteins and found that the luminal domain of GLMP alone, but not its transmembrane domain or its short cytosolic tail, conveys protection and mediates the interaction with MFSD1. The interaction is essential for the stabilization of the complex. N-glycosylation of GLMP is essential for protection. The interaction of both proteins   starts in the endoplasmic reticulum, and quantitatively depends on each other. Both proteins can affect their intracellular trafficking to lysosomes. MFSD1 can form homodimers both in vitro and in vivo (López et al. 2020).	Animals

2.A.1.58.7	"Unc-93 family homologue B1, Unc-93b1 or Unc93b1, of 597 aas and 12 TMSs, plays
 a role in innate and adaptive immunity by regulating 
nucleotide-sensing Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (Pelka et al. 2014). It is required for the 
transport of a subset of TLRs (including TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9) from the 
endoplasmic reticulum to endolysosomes where they can engage pathogen 
nucleotides (e.g., of viral nucleic acids) and activate signaling cascades. Unc93B1 may play a role in 
autoreactive B-cells removal (Isnardi et al. 2008).  It induces apoptotic cell death and is cleaved by host and viral proteases (Harris and Coyne 2015). UNC93B1 may play a role in human oral squamous cell carcinomas growth by controlling the secretion of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Wagai et al. 2019). UNC93B1 regulates Toll-like receptor stability independently of endosomal TLR transport (Pelka et al. 2018). A missense variant affecting the C-terminal tail of UNC93B1 in dogs is responsible for a Exfoliative Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (ECLE) condition (Leeb et al. 2020).  Compartmentalization of TLRs in the endosome limits their activation by self-derived nucleic acids and reduces the possibility of autoimmune reactions. UNC93B1 is indispensable for the trafficking of TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosome. Ishida et al. 2021 reported two cryo-EM structures of human and mouse TLR3-UNC93B1 complexes and a human TLR7-UNC93B1 complex. UNC93B1 exhibits structural similarity to other MFS porters. Both TLRs interact with the UNC93B1 amino-terminal six-helix bundle through their transmembrane and luminal juxtamembrane regions, but the complexes of TLR3 and TLR7 with UNC93B1 differ in their oligomerization state (Ishida et al. 2021). The mammalian trafficking chaperone protein UNC93B1 maintains the ER calcium sensor STIM1 in a dimeric state primed for translocation to the ER cortex (Wang and Demaurex 2022)."

Transmembrane helix I and periplasmic loop 1 are involved in osmosensing and osmoprotectant transport (Keates et al., 2010).  ProP detects the increase in cytoplasmic cation concentration associated with osmotically induced cell dehydration and mediates osmolyte uptake into bacteria (Ozturk et al. 2020). ProP is a 12-TMS protein with an α-helical, cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) linked to TMS XII. The CTD helix associates with the anionic membrane surface to lock ProP in an inactive conformation. The release of the CTD may activate ProP. Molecular dynamics simulations showed specific intrapeptide salt bridges forming when the CTD associated with the membrane. The salt bridge Lys447-Asp455 weakened CTD-lipid interactions at 0.25 M KCl, and gradual stiffening of the membrane with increasing salinity was obseerved. Thus, salt cations may affect CTD release and activate ProP by increasing the order of membrane phospholipids (Ozturk et al. 2020).  ProP forestalls cellular dehydration by detecting environments with high osmotic pressure and mediating the accumulation of organic osmolytes by bacterial cells. Structural determinants and functional significance of dimerization have been described (Ozturk et al. 2023).	Bacteria

2.A.1.7.26	"Na+:glucose co-transporter of 672 aas and about 14 TMSs, SGLT2. It has a Na+ to glucose coupling ratio of 1:1 (Brown et al. 2019). Efficient substrate transport in the mammalian kidney 
is provided by the concerted action of a low affinity high capacity and a
 high affinity low capacity Na+/glucose cotransporter arranged in series along kidney proximal tubules. Inhibitors are antidiabetic agents (Li 2019; Singh and Singh 2020). They are also useful as theraputic agents of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease (Kanbay et al. 2020). Marein, an active component of the Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt plant, ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting renal sodium glucose transporter 2 and activating the AMPK signaling pathway (Guo et al. 2020). NHE-3 (TC# 2.A.53.2.18) was markedly downregulated, while the Na+-HCO3--cotransporter (NBC-1; TC# 2.A.31.2.12) and SGLT2 were upregulated after kidney transplantation (Velic et al. 2004).  Pharmacological inhibition of hSGLT2 by oral small-molecule inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, leads to enhanced excretion of glucose and is widely used in the clinic to manage blood glucose levels for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Niu et al. 2021 determined the cryogenic electron microscopic structure of the hSGLT2-MAP17 complex in the empagliflozin-bound state to a resolution of 2.95 Å. MAP17 interacts with transmembrane helix 13 of hSGLT2. Empagliflozin occupies both the sugar-substrate-binding site and the external vestibule to lock hSGLT2 in an outward-open conformation, thus inhibiting the transport cycle (Niu et al. 2021). There is no upregulation regarding host factors potentially promoting 
SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells when the SGLT2-blocker 
empagliflozin, telmisartan and the DPP4-inhibitor blocker, linagliptin, 
are used (Xiong et al. 2022). Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin significantly inhibit the growth of different cancer cell lines in the micromolar range; SGLT2 inhibitors have antiproliferation, anti-tumorigenesis, and 
anti-migration effects and may induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors also results in the downregulation
 of selected genes (Bardaweel and Issa 2022). SGLT2 inhibitor treatment results in symptomatic and functional 
well-being, especially in relieving pain (Calderon-Rivera et al. 2022). Effects of SGLT2 inhibitors affect the heart and kidney to promote autophagic flux, nutrient deprivation signaling and transmembrane sodium transport (Zannad et al. 2022). Empagliflozin (EMPA), mainly acting on SGLT2, prevented DNA methylation changes induced 
by high glucose and provided evidence of a new mechanism by which SGLT2i
 can exert cardio-beneficial effects (Scisciola et al. 2023). A diversifiable synthetic platform for the discovery of new carbasugar SGLT2 inhibitors using azide-alkyne click chemistry has been described (Kitamura et al. 2023). SGLT2 is inhibited by empagliflozin (Raven et al. 2023). SGLT2 inhibitors not only suppress hyperglycemia but also reduce renal, heart, and cardiovascular diseases (Unno et al. 2023). In fact, SGLT2 may also be related to other functions, such as bone metabolism, longevity, and cognitive functions based on mouse models (Unno et al. 2023). Complex effects of different SGLT2 inhibitors on alphaKlotho gene expression (see TC family 8.A.49) and protein secretion in renal MDCK and HK-2 cells have been observed (Wolf et al. 2023). Ferulic acid-grafted chitosan (FA-g-CS) stimulates the transmembrane transport of anthocyanins by SGLT1 and GLUT2 (Ma et al. 2022). SGLT2 Inhibitors are potential anticancer agents (Basak et al. 2023). Analyses of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis as well as their roles in influencing heart failure outcomes has appeared (Packer et al. 2023).  The SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, alleviates cardiac remodeling and contractile anomalies in a FUNDC1-dependent manner in experimental Parkinson's disease (Yu et al. 2023). Type 2 diabetes guidance proposes offering SGLT2-inhibitor therapy to 
people with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 
or heart failure, but this suggestion has been questioned (Young et al. 2023). SGLT2 inhibition in a non-diabetic rat model of salt-sensitive hypertension 
blunts the development of salt-induced hypertension independent of sex (Kravtsova et al. 2023)."	GLUT2 of Homo sapiens

2.A.1.7.4	"Rat kidney Na+-dependent glucose (methyl α-glucoside) transporter, NaGLT1 or SGLT1 (glucose:Na+:Na+=1:1) (Horiba et al., 2003). Position 170 of Rabbit Na+/glucose cotransporter (rSGLT1) lies in the Na+ pathway, and modulation of polarity/charge at this site regulates charge transfer and carrier turnover (Huntley et al. 2004). The fine-tuning of glucose uptake mechanisms is rendered by various 
glucose transporters with distinct transport characteristics. In the 
pancreatic islet, facilitative diffusion glucose transporters (GLUTs), 
and sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) contribute to glucose uptake 
and represent important components in the glucose-stimulated hormone 
release from endocrine cells, therefore playing a crucial role in blood 
glucose homeostasis (Berger and Zdzieblo 2020). SGLT1 and SGLT2 are therapeutic targets for various diseases (Sano et al. 2020), and function in glucose absorption in the small intestine (Vallon 2020).

2.A.1.70.9	"ArsK, exporter of arsenite, antimonite, trivalent roxarsone and methylarsenite (Shi et al. 2018). Expression of arsK is induced by arsenite [As(III)], antimonite

 arsenate [As(V)], and heterologous expression of ArsK in an

2.A.1.8.11	The 24 TMS, 2 domain, NarK1-NarK2 porter (NarK1 = a NO3-/H+ symporter; NarK2 = a NO3-/NO2- antiporter).  NarK1 is a nitrate/proton symporter with high affinity for nitrate while NarK2 is a nitrate/nitrite antiporter with lower affinity for nitrate (Goddard et al., 2008).  Each transporter requires two conserved arginine residues for activity.  A transporter consisting of inactivated NarK1 fused to active NarK2 has a dramatically increased affinity for nitrate compared with NarK2 alone, implying a functional interaction between the two domains (Goddard et al., 2008).	Bacteria
2.A.1.8.12	The root cortical and epidermal cell, high affinity, plasma membrane, NO3- uptake transporter, NRT2.1 (Wirth et al., 2007).

Activity only occurs when NRT2.1 is complexed with NAR2.1 (WR3; 8.A.20.1.1) in a 2:2 tetrameric complex (Yong et al., 2010). NAR2.1 has an N-terminal and a C-terminal TMS and has been annotated as a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase family member (Yong et al., 2010).  Ntr transporters may also play a role in gaseous NO2 uptake by leaves (Hu et al. 2014).  The Medicago truncatula orthologue has been characterized (Pellizzaro et al. 2014). An NRT2 homologue in wheat has been identifed and partially characterized (Kumar et al. 2022). Nitrate is the main form of inorganic nitrogen that crops absorb, and nitrate transporters 2 (NRT2) are high affinity nitrate uptake porters. When the available nitrate is limiting, the high affinity transport systems are activated. Most NRT2s cannot transport nitrates alone and require the assistance of helper proteins belonging to nitrate assimilation related family (NAR2; TC# 8.A.20.1.1) to complete the transport of nitrate (Zhao et al. 2023). Crop nitrogen utilization efficiency is affected by environmental conditions, and there are differences between different plant varieties.  Sorghum bicolor has high stress tolerance and is efficient in soil nitrogen utilization. The S. bicolor genome database was scanned for gene structures, chromosomal localizations, physicochemical properties, secondary structures and transmembrane domains, signal peptides and subcellular localizations, promoter region cis-acting elements, phylogenetic evolution, SNP recognition and annotation, and selection pressure of gene family members (Zhao et al. 2023). Through bioinformatics analysis, 5 NRT2 gene members (designated as SbNRT2-1a, SbNRT2-1b, SbNRT2-2, SbNRT2-3, and SbNRT2-4) and 2 NAR2 gene members (designated SbNRT3-1 and SbNRT3-2) were identified, the number of which was less than that of foxtail millet. SbNRT2/3 could be divided into four subfamilies. All were present in the plasma membrane; SbNRT2 proteins lacked signal peptides, but SbNRT3 proteins contained them. Expression was responsive to plant hormones and stress response elements (Zhao et al. 2023).	Plants

The narK1 and narK2 genes are located in an operon, narK1K2GHJI, with the structural genes for the nitrate reductase complex.  Utilizing an isogenic narK1 mutant, a narK2 mutant, and a narK1K2 double mutant, Sharma et al. 2006 explored the effect on growth under denitrifying conditions. While the ΔnarK1::Gm mutant was only slightly affected, but both the ΔnarK2::Gm and double mutants exhibited poor nitrate-dependent, anaerobic growth although all three strains had wild-type levels of nitrate reductase activity. Nitrate uptake measurements showed that NarK2 has most of the activity.  E. coli narK rescued both mutants.	NarK2 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

3.A.23.6.1	"To interact with other cells, bacteria use contractile machines that 
function similarly to membrane-puncturing bacteriophages. The so-called 
type 6 secretion system (T6SS) functions from inside a bacterial cell. 
Böck et al. used modern electron microscopy methods and 
functional assays to resolve the structure and function of a T6SS in the
 cellular context. They identified three modules and showed large-scale 
structural changes upon firing. T6SSs are organized in multibarrel 
gun-like arrays and may contribute to the survival of bacteria inside 
their host. 
Contractile
 injection systems (CISs) deliver effectors to mediate bacterial 
cell-cell interactions. Their structural components are homologous to 
the contractile tails of phages (1).
 CISs consist of an inner tube surrounded by a contractile sheath, a 
spike capping the inner tube, and a baseplate complex at the base of the
 sheath. Sheath contraction propels the inner tube into the target. Two 
modes of action divide CISs into “extracellular CISs” (eCISs) and “type 6
 secretion” (T6S) systems (T6SSs). eCISs resemble headless phages; they 
are released into the medium and bind to the target cell surface. 
Examples are antibacterial R-type bacteriocins (Leiman and Shneider 2012), insecticidal antifeeding prophages (Afps) (Hurst et al. 2004), and metamorphosis-inducing structures (MACs) (Shikuma et al. 2014). By contrast, the T6SS is defined by its cytoplasmic localization and anchoring to the inner membrane (Basler et al. 2012; Hachani et al. 2016); Chang et al. 2017).
Amoebophilus asiaticus is an obligate intracellular bacterial symbiont of amoebae. The Amoebophilus genome does not encode known secretion systems, but it contains a gene cluster with similarities to that of Afps. Böck et al. 2017 reasoned that the Afp-like gene cluster might encode a system that 
would give insight into T6SS structure, function, and evolution.
Thus, the Amoebophilus Afp-like gene cluster encodes a T6SS (Böck et al. 2017). Sequence analyses 
indicated a close relationship to eCISs, and the term
 “T6SS subtype 4” (T6SSiv) was therefore introduced. In contrast to the distant relationships of T6SSi-iii to eCISs and phages that obstruct the reconstruction of an evolutionary path (1, 24), it can be hypothesized that T6SSiv evolved from an Afp/MAC-like eCIS (independently of T6SSi-iii)
 by the loss of tail fibers, loss of holin, and the establishment of 
interactions with the cytoplasmic membrane. Alternatively, T6SSiv represents a primordial system from which eCISs, phages, and T6SSi-iii evolved. T6SSiv-like
 gene clusters were detected in six diverse bacterial phyla. 
The finding that diverse T6SS subtypes do not share a conserved gene set
 that would distinguish them from eCISs or phages emphasizes the 
necessity of an integrative approach to discover and characterize new 
systems. This situation is reminiscent of type IV secretion systems (3.A.7)."

3.A.16.1.1	"Mammalian ER retrotranslocon. The Grp170 protein plays a role during ERAD, positioning 
this client-release factor at the retrotranslocation site, allowing a 
mechanism to couple client release from BiP and retrotranslocation (Inoue and Tsai, 2016). The cryo-EM structure of the ERAD protein channel, formed by tetrameric human Derlin-1, has been solved (Rao et al. 2021). 
 The structure shows that Derlin-1 forms a homotetramer that encircles a
 large tunnel traversing the ER membrane. The tunnel has a diameter of 
about 12 to 15 angstroms, large enough to allow an α-helix to pass 
through. The structure shows a lateral gate within the membrane, 
providing access of transmembrane proteins to the tunnel. Thus, Derlin-1
 forms a protein channel for translocation of misfolded proteins. This 
structure is different from the monomeric yeast Derlin structure 
previously reported, which forms a semichannel with another protein (Rao et al. 2021)."	Animals
3.A.16.1.2	ER retrotranslocon for misfolded luminal ER proteins.  Uses the ERAD-associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, Hrd1p, which promotes polypeptide movement through the ER membrane (Carvalho et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2011). As determined by cryoEM, Hrd1 is an 8 TMS dimer that associates with Hrd3 on the luminal side of the ER membrane to seal the channel used for protein retrotranslocation (Schoebel et al., 2017). The protein-conducting channel, Hrd1, is a ubiquitin ligase that serves as the transmembrane channel (Wu and Rapoport, 2018). The Cdc48/p97 ATPase pulls the unfolded substrate through the channel, out of the membrane. Cdc48 has a central pore, and the substrate protein passes from the cis side to the trans side (Wu and Rapoport, 2018). Otu1, ubiquitin thio ligase, partially de-ubiquitinates the substrate protein. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase accepts ubiquitin specifically from endoplasmic reticulum-associated UBC6 and UBC7 E2 ligases, and transfers it to substrates, promoting their degradation. It mediates the degradation of a broad range of substrates, including endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, soluble nuclear proteins and soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The DOA10 ubiquitin ligase complex is part of the ERAD-C pathway responsible for the rapid degradation of membrane proteins with misfolded cytoplasmic domains (Ravid et al., 2006). The 3-D structure of the Hrd1 complex (including Hrd1, Hrd3, Der1, Usa1 and Yos9) has been solved (Wu et al. 2020). It mediates the retrotranslocation of the polypeptide into the cytosol, which it is polyubiqutinated, extracted from the membrane by the Cdc48 ATPase complex and degraded by a proteosome. The importance of Hrd1 complex integrity during ERAD, suggests that allosteric interactions between transmembrane domains regulate Hrd1 complex formation (Nakatsukasa et al. 2022).	Yeast

requires SEL1L, Derlin2 or Derlin3, and Herp1 or Herp2 (Sugimoto et al. 2017).

3.A.16.1.6	"The yeast multicomponent mitochondrial outer membrane-associated protein degradation (MOM-PD) pathway. Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires 
mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins (quality control 
pathways). Metzger et al. 2020 established temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins as novel model QC substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
 The ts-proteins Sen2-1HA(ts) (P16658; 329 aas, 0 TMSs) and 
Sam35-2HA(ts) (P14693; 329 aas and 1 TMS) are degraded using the MOM-PD 
pathway involving
 the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of Sen2-1HA(ts) is 
mediated by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Ubr1, while Sam35-2HA(ts) is 
ubiquitinated primarily by San1. 
Mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires 
the SSA family of Hsp70s (e.g., P10591; 642 aas and 0 TMSs) and the 
Hsp40 Sis1 (P25294; 352 aas and 0 TMSs), providing evidence for 
chaperone involvement in MOM-PD. In addition to a role for the 
Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex (see TC# 3.A.16.1.2), Doa1 and a 
mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are 
implicated in their degradation. Thus, a unique QC pathway consists of a
 combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors and distinguishes it 
from other cellular QC pathways (Metzger et al. 2020). Nevertheless, most of the protein constituents have homologs in TC family 3.A.16."

Apparent subconductance openings provide most of the K+ flux when the SR membrane potential is close to zero (Matyjaszkiewicz et al. 2015).  Mutations give rise to osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in humans, a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders
characterized by decreased bone mass and recurrent bone fractures (Lv et al. 2016)."	Animals (Vertebrates and Invertebrates)
1.A.62.1.3	"TMEM38B/TRIC-B of 291 aas and 6 TMSs.  Monovalent cation channel required for

potassium counter-ion channel that functions in synchrony with 
calcium release from intracellular stores (Haralambieva et al. 2022).  Required for intracellular homeostasis and is responsible for a mild form of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. TRIC-B is proposed to counterbalance IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Cabral et al. 2016). TMEM38B, whose expression is dependent on BACE2 (TC# 8.A.32.1.2), modulates calcium release from the ER in ocular melanoma, and inhibition of the BACE2/TMEM38B axis could trigger exhaustion of intracellular calcium release while inhibiting tumor progression (He et al. 2021).

(PtdIns(4,5)P2, also known as PIP2) lipid molecules. The TRIC-B1/B2 proteins and PIP2 assemble into
a symmetrical homotrimeric complex. Each monomer contains an hourglass-shaped hydrophilic por within a seven-transmembrane-helix domain. Structural and functional analyses revealed the
central role of PIP2 in stabilizing the cytoplasmic gate of the ion permeation pathway and showed a
marked Ca2+-induced conformational change in a cytoplasmic 
loop above the gate. A mechanistic model was proposed to account for the
 complex gating mechanism of TRIC channels (Yang et al. 2016)."	TRICB1/B2 of Caenorhabditis elegans

1.A.62.3.1	"Archaeal TRIC family homologue of 205 aas and 7 TMSs.  In animals, Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for
muscle contraction, cell growth, apoptosis, learning and memory. The eukaryotic TRIC channels are cation channels balancing the SR and ER membrane
potentials, and are implicated in Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis. Kasuya et al. 2016 presented crystal

In a 2.2-Å resolution K+-bound structure, ion/water densities have been resolved inside the pore (PDB# 5H35) (Su et al. 2017). At the central region, a filter-like structure is shaped by the kinks on the second and fifth transmembrane helices and two nearby phenylalanine residues. Below the filter, the cytoplasmic vestibule is occluded by a plug-like motif attached to an array of pore-lining charged residues (Kasuya et al. 2016). The asymmetric filter-like structure at the pore center of SsTRIC may serve as a basis for the channel to bind and select monovalent cations, K+ and Na+ (Ou et al. 2017)."	Archaea

The oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an 
asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent 
polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation. 
N-Glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, and the complex associates with
 the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that 
mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Ribophorin I associates with a subset of membrane proteins after their integration at the Sec61 translocon (Wilson et al. 2005). All subunits are required for maximal enzyme activity. The SST3 subunit 
contains the active site and the acceptor peptide and donor lipid-linked
 oligosaccharide (LLO) binding pockets. STT3A is present
 in the majority of OST complexes and mediates cotranslational 
N-glycosylation of most sites on target proteins, while STT3B-containing
 complexes are required for efficient post-translational glycosylation 
and mediate glycosylation of sites that have been skipped by STT3A 
(Ruiz-Canada et al. 2009). High-resolution cryo-EM structures of human OST-A and 
OST-B have been described (Ramírez et al. 2019). Although the two complexes have similar overall architectures, structural 
differences in the catalytic subunits, STT3A and STT3B, facilitate 
contacts to distinct OST subunits, DC2 in OST-A and MAGT1 in OST-B. In 
OST-A, interactions with TMEM258 and STT3A allow ribophorin-I to form a 
four-helix bundle that can bind to a translating ribosome, whereas the 
equivalent region is disordered in OST-B. An acceptor 
peptide and dolichylphosphate are bound to STT3B, but only dolichylphosphate
is bound in STT3A, suggesting distinct affinities of the two OST complexes for 
protein substrates (Ramírez et al. 2019)."

9.B.142.5.6	The structure of the yeast O-mannosyltransferase Pmt1-Pmt2 complex has been determined at 3.2 Å resolution (Bai et al. 2019). In eukaryotes, a nascent peptide entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is scanned by two Sec61 translocon-associated large membrane machines for protein N-glycosylation and protein O-mannosylation, respectively. The structures of both the eight-protein oligosaccharyltransferase complex and the mannosyltransferases of the PMT family have been determined.  They function in ER protein homeostasis. Cryo-EM structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pmt1-Pmt2 complex bound to a donor and an acceptor peptide shows that each subunit contains 11 TMSs and a lumenal beta-trefoil fold termed the MIR domain. The structures reveal the substrate recognition site and confirms an inverting mannosyl-transferring reaction mechanism. The transmembrane domains of Pmt1 and Pmt2 share a structural fold with the catalytic subunits of oligosaccharyltransferases, confirming an evolutionary relationship between protein O-mannosylation and protein N-glycosylation (Bai et al. 2019).

3.A.2.1.1	"H+-translocating F-type ATPase. The loop-regions in subunits a and c that are implicated in H+ transport likely
interact in a single structural domain which then functions in gating H+ release to the
cytoplasm (Steed et al. 2014). Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme have been observed, with the central stalk's epsilon subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states (Sobti et al. 2016). The Fo motor consists of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring, and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30 degrees to the membrane, a feature corresponding to rotary ATPases. This rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk, is resolved over the entire length of the complex, revealing the F1 attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit a from two sides (Sobti et al. 2016). Reversible beta/epsilon (stator/rotor) interactions may block rotation and thereby inhibit catalysis (Bulygin et al. 2004). Current views on unidirectional catalysis by the F1·Fo ATP synthase/ATPase have been reviewed (Zharova et al. 2023). Hypermucoviscosity is a hallmark of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and OmpR regulates its energy status, via the F-type ATPase of this organism; this influences hypermucoviscosity (Wang et al. 2023)."

3.A.2.1.11	F-type ATP synthase of 8 subunits common to other ATPases, and 9 subunits unique to the Chlorophyta.  Near neighbor interactions of the membrane subunits have been measured (Sánchez-Vásquez et al. 2017).  The spinich enzyme has been solved at 3.4 Å resolution by cryoEM (Hahn et al. 2018).  The protein has 26 protein subunits, 17 of them membrane embedded.  Its c-ring has 14 c subunits. Hahn et al. 2018 observed 3 chloroplast F1F0 conformations with the central rotor stalled in different positions, and ring rotation seemed to be divided into 3 unequal stteps. The stoichiometrically mismatched c-ring of F0s (composed of 8 to 17 c-subunits) and the 3-fold symmetric F1 head are flexibly coupled (Murphy et al. 2019).  Based on cryo EM 2.7 Å resolution structures, 13 rotary states suggest a mechanism of the rotational movement, and the functions of novel subunits are proposed (Murphy et al. 2019). The chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1Fo) contains a feature specific to the green lineage: a gamma-subunit redox domain that contains a cysteine couple which interacts with the torque-transmitting betaDELSEED-loop. This thiol modulation equips CF1Fo with an important environmental fine-tuning mechanism. In vitro, disulfide formation in the gamma-redox domain slows down the activity of CF1Fo at low transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. ATP synthase regulation by the proton motive force (pmf) and thiol modulation occur in Arabidopsis leaves (Buchert et al. 2021).	F-type ATP synthase of Polytomella sp.

It forms half channels that allow Na+ to enter and leave the buried carboxyl group on the Fo-c subunits. The essential Arg residue, R226, which faces the carboxyl group of Fo-c subunits in the middle of transmembrane helix 5 of the Fo-a subunit, separates the cytoplasmic side and periplasmic half-channels (Mitome et al. 2017). Residues that contribute to the integrity of the Na+ half channels have been identified; both half channels are present in the Fo-a subunit (Mitome et al. 2017).	Bacteria
3.A.2.1.3	"H+-translocating F-type ATPase. Evidence of the proximity of ATP synthase subunit 6 is in proximity to the membrane in the supramolecular form (Velours et al., 2011).  The structure of the intact monomeric ATP synthase from the fungus, Pichia angusta, has been solved
by electron cryo-microscopy (Vinothkumar et al. 2016). The Mg2+ and Ca2+-dependent enzymes are both active, but exhibit quite different behaviors (Nesci et al. 2017). Dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds (cristae) characteristic of mitochondria.  Using cryo-electron microscopy, Guo et al. 2017 determined the structure of the dimeric FO complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the 
protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how 
the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae. The crystal structure of the c-subunit ring with 
bound oligomycin revealed the inhibitor docked on the outer face of the 
proton-binding sites, deep in the transmembrane region (Zhou and Faraldo-Gómez 2018). A high resolution (3.7 Å) structure of the entire monomeric ATPase has been solved by cryo EM, suggesting how it is inhibited by oligomycin (Srivastava et al. 2018).  Absence of the e and g subunits decreases conductance of the F-ATP synthase channel about tenfold. Ablation of the first TMS of subunit b, which creates a distinct lateral domain with e and g, further affected channel activity. Thus, F-ATP synthase e, g and b subunits create a domain within the membrane that is critical for the generation of the high-conductance channel that is a prime candidate for formation of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Subunits e and g are only present in eukaryotes and may have evolved to confer this novel function to F-ATP synthases (Carraro et al. 2018). The translation rate of all yeast mitochondrial mRNAs, including all F-type ATPase subunits has been studied (Chicherin et al. 2021). Attenuated ADP-inhibition of F0F1 ATPase mitigates manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast (Lapashina et al. 2022)."	Yeast

The enzyme appears to play a role in salt tolerance (Soontharapirakkul et al. 2011). This halotolerant cyanobacterium has both a Na+- and a H+-pumping ATPase (see TC# 3.A.2.1.10).

The system is involved in the active export of H+ from the cytoplasm (Wunderlich 2022).	V-type ATPase of Plasmodium falciparum
3.A.2.2.2	Na+-translocating V-type ATPase. The V-ATPase of E. hirae (EhV-ATPase) is composed of a soluble catalytic domain (V1; NtpA3-B3-D-G) and an integral membrane domain (V0; NtpI-K10) connected by a central and two peripheral stalks (NtpC, NtpD-G and NtpE-F) (see schematic figure 1 on pg. 60 of Muhammed et al., 2012). The membrane rotor ring of the Na+-ATPase consists of 10 NtpK subunits, which are homologs of the 16-KDa and 8-KDa proteolipids found in other V-ATPases and F-ATPases. Each NtpK subunit has four transmembrane alpha helices, with a sodium ion bound between helices 2 and 4 at a site buried deeply in the membrane that includes the essential residue glutamate-139 (Murata et al. 2005). This site is probably connected to the membrane surface by two half-channels in subunit NtpI, against which the ring rotates. Symmetry mismatch between the rotor and catalytic domains appears to be an intrinsic feature of both V- and F-ATPases (Murata et al. 2005). The EhV-ATPase is a Na+ pump in. Tsunoda et al. 2018 presented the entire structure of detergent-solubilized EhV-ATPase by single-particle cryo-EM using Zernike phase plates. The cryo-EM map showed one of three catalytic conformations. To further stabilize the originally heterogeneous structure caused by ATP hydrolysis, a peptide epitope tag system interfered with rotation of the central rotor by binding the Fab. As a result, the map unexpectedly showed another catalytic conformation of EhV-ATPase. These two conformations with and without Fab conversely coincided with those of the minor state 2 and the major state 1 of Thermus thermophilus V/A-ATPase, respectively. The most prominent feature in EhV-ATPase was the off-axis rotor, where the cytoplasmic V1 domain was connected to the Vo domain through the off-axis central rotor. Compared to the structure of ATP synthases, the larger size of the interface between the transmembrane a-subunit and c-ring of EhV-ATPase would be more advantageous for active ion pumping (Tsunoda et al. 2018).	Bacteria
3.A.2.2.3	"H+-translocating V-type ATPase.  The d-subunit couples ATP hydrolysis to H+  transport (Owegi et al., 2006).  The a subunit (Vph1p) most likely has an 8 TMS topology (Kartner et al. 2013; Knight and Behm 2012).  Structures for three
rotational states show ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP:H+ ratio for proton
pumping. Long tilted TMSs in
the a-subunit interact with the c-ring.  V-ATPase's membrane sector, Vo, has been implicated in functions including
membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release. Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016 reported that the purified V-ATPase c subunit ring (c-ring) forms dimers mediated by the c subunits'
cytoplasmic loops. Electrophysiological measurements of the c-ring reconstituted into a planar lipid
bilayer revealed a large unitary conductance of ~8.3 nS.  A role of the
c-ring in membrane fusion and neuronal communication was suggested (Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016).   The three different maps reveal the conformational
changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the
membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits undergo
conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states (Zhao et al. 2015). The structures
of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth
transmission of power through rotary ATPases.
Increases in glucose stimulate V-ATPase assembly and activity while glucose deprivation triggers rapid V-ATPase disassembly and inactivation in 
yeast. However, the opposite phenomenon is observed in mammalian 
cells, specifically that V-ATPase assembly and activation increases when
 glucose is lost (Parra and Hayek 2018).   The 3.5 Å resolution cryoEM structure of the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted Vo proton channel, captured in a physiologically relevant
 autoinhibited state, revealing the residues that constitute the proton 
pathway at the interface of the proteolipid ring and subunit a has been solved (Roh et al. 2018). The chemical basis of transmembrane proton transport was proposed. Roh et al. 2018 discovered that the C terminus of the assembly factor Voa1 (TC# 9.B.206.2.1)) is an 
integral component of the mature Vo. Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane alpha 
helix is bound inside the proteolipid ring, where it contributes to the 
stability of the complex. The structure rationalizes possible mechanisms
 by which mutations in human Vo can result in disease phenotypes (Roh et al. 2018). The cytosolic N-terminal domain of the V-ATPase a-subunits is a regulatory hub targeted by multiple signals (Tuli and Kane 2023).
    An arginine residue (Arg-735) in transmembrane helix 7 (TMS7) of subunit a of the yeast ATPase is known to be essential
 for proton translocation. Arginine residues are usually assumed to 
'snorkel' toward the protein surface when exposed to a hydrophobic 
environment. However, Hohlweg et al. 2018 obtained evidence for
 the formation of a transient, membrane-embedded cation-π interaction in
 TM7 between Arg-735 and two highly conserved nearby aromatic residues, 
Tyr-733 and Trp-737. They proposed a mechanism by which the transient, 
membrane-embedded cation-π complex provides the necessary energy to keep
 the charged side chain of Arg-735 within the hydrophobic membrane. Such
 cation-π interactions may define a general mechanism to retain charged 
amino acids in a hydrophobic membrane environment (Hohlweg et al. 2018). A  2.7-A cryo-EM structure of the yeast Vo proton channel revealed the 
location of ordered water molecules along the proton path, details of 
specific protein-lipid interactions, and the architecture of the 
membrane scaffold protein (Roh et al. 2020) as well as a state of Vo showing the c-ring rotated by ~14 degrees. Two rotary states are in thermal equilibrium and depict how the protonation state of essential glutamic acid residues couples water-mediated proton transfer with c-ring rotation. Resuts suggest a mechanism for inhibition of passive proton transport as observed for free Vo that is generated as a result of V-ATPase regulation by reversible disassembly in vivo (Roh et al. 2020). Vacuolar H+-ATPase dysfunction rescues intralumenal vesicle cargo sorting in yeast lacking PI(3,5)P2 or Doa4 (Wilson et al. 2021). The V-ATPase a-subunit is a two-domain protein containing a C-terminal transmembrane domain responsible for proton transport and an N-terminal cytosolic domain that is a regulatory hub, integrating environmental inputs to regulate assembly, localization, and V-ATPase activity. S. cerevisiae encodes two organelle-specific a-isoforms, Stv1 in the Golgi and Vph1 in the vacuole (Tuli and Kane 2023). The significance of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and V-ATPase for growth and pathogenicity in pathogenic fungi has been discussed (Yang and Peng 2023)."	Eukaryotes
3.A.2.2.4	"The 14 subunit vacuolar H+-ATPase, V1/V0, has been implicated in various human diseases including osteopetrosis, renal tubule acidosis, and cancer (Hinton et al., 2009).  The transmembrane enzyme, Ribonuclease kappa, RNASEK (137 aas; 2 TMSs; UniProt acc# Q6P5S7), closely associates with the V-ATPase and is required for its function;
its loss prevents the early events of endocytosis and the replication of multiple pathogenic
viruses (Perreira et al. 2015).  Cryo-EM allowed the construction of an atomic model, defining the enzyme's ATP:proton ratio as 3:10 and revealing a homolog of yeast subunit f in the membrane region, which appeared to be RNAseK (Abbas et al. 2020). The c ring encloses the transmembrane anchors for cleaved ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR, the latter of which is the (pro)renin receptor that, in other contexts, is involved in both Wnt signaling and the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. This structure shows how ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR enable assembly of the enzyme's catalytic and membrane regions (Abbas et al. 2020). V-ATPase inhibitors, concanamycin and indole pentadiene, inhibit the enzyme by entry through the lipid membrane (Páli et al. 2004). ATP6V1, subunit H deficiency impairs glucose tolerance by augmenting endoplasmic reticulum stress in high fat diet fed mice (Yang et al. 2022). Defective lysosomal acidification provides a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (Lo and Zeng 2023).  Variants in ATP6V1B2 are related to a heterogeneous group of multisystemic disorders sometimes associated with variable neurological involvement, including developmental epileptic encephalopathies (Amore et al. 2023). The subunit, ATP6V0A4 is a potential biomarker in renal cell carcinoma (Xu et al. 2023)."	Animals

that actively prevents Ca2+ stores from overfilling, acting 
as a ""Cacium Load-activated Calcium channel"" or """"CLAC"""" channel. TMCO1 
undergoes reversible homotetramerization in
response to ER Ca2+ overloading and disassembly upon Ca2+ depletion to form a Ca2+-selective
ion channel as demonstrated in liposomes (Wang et al. 2016). TMCO1 knockout mice reproduce the main clinical features of human
cerebrofaciothoracic (CFT) dysplasia spectrum, a developmental disorder linked to TMCO1 dysfunction,
and exhibit severe mishandling of ER Ca2+ in cells (Alanay et al. 2014). Thus, TMCO1 provides a
protective mechanism to prevent overfilling of ER stores with calcium ions (Wang et al. 2016). It regulates Ca2+ stores in granulosa cells (Sun et al. 2018).  TMCO1-mediated Ca2+ leak underlies osteoblast functions via CaMKII signaling (Li et al. 2019). The TMCO1 gene is a tumor suppressor in urinary bladder urothelial carcinomas (UBUC). TMCO1 dysregulates cell-cycle progression via suppression of the AKT pathway, and S60 of the TMCO1 protein is crucial for its tumor-suppressor roles (Li et al. 2017). Batchelor-Regan et al. 2021 published a short review about the clinical and scientific advances made with TMCO1. Ca2+ homeostasis maintained by TMCO1 underlies corpus callosum development via ERK signaling (Yang et al. 2022). A mechanism of metformin action, restoring cellular ER homeostasis, enabled the development of a nanocarrier-mediated ER targeting strategy for remodeling diabetic periodontal tissue (Zhong et al. 2022). TMCO1 regulates cell proliferation, metastasis and EMT signaling through CALR, promoting ovarian cancer progression and cisplatin resistance (Sun et al. 2024).  TMCO1 is a crucial regulator of ovarian cancer progression, influencing VDAC1 through CALR and impacting diverse cellular processes (Sun et al. 2024)."

3.A.19.1.1	"The ATP hydrolysis-dependent TRC receptor TRC40 (Asna-1) which functions as a chaparone protein, feeding into the WRB/CAML transporter complex (McDowell et al. 2020; Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007). TRC40 is homologous to the ArsA  ATPase of E. coli (TC# 3.A.4.1.1) and the GET3 ATPase of yeast (TC# 8.A.26.1.1). Loss yields embryonic lethality. Tryptophan-rich basic protein (WRB) is the tail-anchored (TA) protein insertion receptor, also called congenital heart disease protein-5 (CHD5). It is related to the yeast Get1 protein in 3.A.21.1.1. Calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is a mammal-specific receptor for TRC40, an ATPase targeting newly synthesized TA proteins.  CAML mediates membrane insertion of TA proteins.  TRC40 (Asna1) has been shown to mediate membrane insertion of two proteins, RAMP4 and Sec61beta, without
the participation of other cytosolic proteins by a mechanism that depends on the presence of ATP or
ADP and a protease-sensitive receptor in the ER membrane (Favaloro et al. 2010).  TRC40 is required for release of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) virions (Ott et al. 2016). The functions and reciprocal interactions of the two subunits of the heteromeric TRC40 recpeptor, WBR and CAML (CAMLG), have revealed mutual dependencies for stability; CAML seems to normally be present in 5-fold excess over WBR (Colombo et al. 2016). CAMLG interacts with Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) p7 and mediates calcium permeability in the ER (Gladue et al. 2018). Retro-2 (Morgens et al. 2019) protects cells from ricin and Shiga-like toxin toxicity by inhibiting ASNA1-mediated ER targeting and insertion of tail-anchored proteins (Morgens et al. 2019). Get3 (TRC40) binding to the membrane insertase supports heterotetramer formation, and phosphatidylinositol binding at the heterotetramer interface stabilizes the insertase for efficient TA insertion in vivo. McDowell et al. 2020 identified a Get2/CAML cytoplasmic helix that forms a ""gating"" interaction with Get3/TRC40, important for TA insertion. Structural homology with YidC and the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) suggests an evolutionarily conserved insertion mechanism for divergent substrates utilizing a hydrophilic groove (McDowell et al. 2020).  The WRB subunit of the Get3 receptor is required for the correct integration of its partner CAML into the ER (Carvalho et al. 2019). Close coordination between chaperones is essential for the delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins containing a single C-terminal TMS to the ER by the GET pathway. For successful targeting, nascent TA proteins must be promptly chaperoned and loaded onto the cytosolic ATPase Get3 through a transfer reaction involving the chaperone SGTA and bridging factors, Get4, Ubl4a and Bag6. Keszei et al. 2021 reported cryo-EM structures of metazoan pretargeting GET complexes at 3.3-3.6 Å resolution. Get3 helix 8 and the Get4 C terminus form a composite lid over the Get3 substrate-binding chamber that is opened by SGTA. Another interaction with Get4 prevents formation of Get3 helix 4, which links the substrate chamber and ATPase domain. Both interactions facilitate TA protein transfer from SGTA to Get3 (Keszei et al. 2021)."	Animals

3.A.19.1.4	"ArsA1 of 777 aas.  ATPase is required for the post-translational 
delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the chloroplast. It is also required for
 the accumulation of TOC34, an essential component of the outer 
chloroplast membrane translocon (TOC) complex (Formighieri et al. 2013, Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017). ArsA1 recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA 
proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets the protein to the chloroplast, where
 the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is 
regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis (Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017). Both ArsA proteins exhibit oxyanion-independent ATPase activity, but co-expression of ArsA proteins with TA-transmembrane regions showed not only that the former interacts with the latter, but that ArsA1 does not share the same ligand specificity as ArsA2. ArsA1 mainly carries TA-proteins to the chloroplast, while ArsA2 carries them to the endoplasmic reticulum (Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017).  Lin et al. 2019 presented crystal structures of algal ArsA1 (a Get3 homolog) in a 
distinct nucleotide-free open state and bound to 
adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. This approximately 80-kDa protein possesses a
 monomeric architecture, with two ATPase domains in a single polypeptide

mitochondrial (TOM7) TA proteins based on features of its transmembrane 
domain as well as the regions immediately before and after the 
transmembrane domain. Several helices located above the TA-binding 
groove comprise the interlocking hook-like motif implicated by 
mutational analyses in TA substrate recognition. The data of Lin et al. 2019 provide

endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the 
tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is

facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP 
hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer 
reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the 
membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a 
new round of targeting."	ArsA2 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas smithii)

3.A.5.1.1	"General secretory pathway (Sec-SRP) complex.  A biphasic pulling force may act on TMSs during translocon-mediated membrane integration (Ismail et al. 2012).  Intermediate structures for the insertion of integral membrane proteins have been visualized (Bischoff et al. 2014).  Insertion of the Type II single span (N-terminus, in, C-terminus, out) protein, RodZ, requires only SecYEG, SecA and the pmf, but not SecB, SecDF, YidC or FtsY (Rawat et al. 2015).  The combined effects of
ribosome and peptide binding to SecYEG may allow for co-translational membrane insertion of successive
transmembrane segments (Ge et al. 2014). SecA penetrates deeply into the SecYEG channel during insertion, contacting transmembrane helices and periplasmic loops (Banerjee et al. 2017). A partially inserted nascent chain unzips the Sec translocon's lateral gate (Kater et al. 2019). Cardiolipin (CL) is required in vivo for the stability of the bacterial translocon (SecYEG) as well as
 its efficient function in co-translational insertion into and 
translocation across the inner membrane of E. coli (Ryabichko et al. 2020). PpiD (623 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D, and YfgM (206 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS) facilitate the transport of toxins into the E. coli cell in a SecY-dependent process (Jones et al. 2021). Synchronized real-time measurement of Sec-mediated protein translocation has been described (Gupta et al. 2021). An extracellular cutinase from Amycolatopsis mediterranei (AmCut) is able to degrade the plastics, polycaprolactone and polybutylene succinate (Tan et al. 2022). It is secreted from E. coli using the Sec system for export across the inner membrane, and possibly, a non-classical secretion pathway for export across the outer membrane (Tan et al. 2022). The inner membrane YfgM-PpiD heterodimer, both proteins with N-terminal transmembrane segments and C-terminal periplasmic domains, acts as a functional unit that associates with the SecY/E/G translocon and promotes protein translocation (Miyazaki et al. 2022).

SRP43 is an ATP-independent chaperone containing ankyrin repeats

These extra Sec systems are found in species of Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Listeria (Rigel and Braunstein, 2008). A region of approximately 20 residues from the amino-terminal end of mature GspB (the accessory Sec transport or AST domain) is essential, possibly as an α-helix, for SecA2/Y2-dependent transport. This AST domain may be essential, both for targeting to the SecA2/Y2 translocase, and for initiating translocation through the SecY2 channel (Bensing & Sullam et al., 2010).  The functions of SecA2 have been reviewed (Bensing et al. 2013).

functional translocation channel. The alpha-subunit (SecY) has two linked 
halves, transmembrane segments 1-5 and 6-10, clamped together by the 
gamma-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged 
by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an 
'hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. 
This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, 
hindering the permeation of other molecules. The structure also suggests
 mechanisms for signal-sequence recognition and for the lateral exit of 
transmembrane segments of nascent membrane proteins into lipid, and 
indicates binding sites for partners that provide the driving force for 
translocation (Van den Berg et al. 2004).  Comparing the permeability of 18 metabolites demonstrated that diether glycerol-1-phosphate lipids with methyl branches, often the most abundant membrane lipids of sampled archaea, are permeable to a wide range of compounds useful for core metabolic networks, including amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. Permeability is significantly lower in diester glycerol-3-phosphate lipids without methyl branches, the common building block of bacterial membranes (Łapińska et al. 2023)."

3.A.5.8.1	"The general secretory pathway (Sec-SRP) complex. The Yet1 and Yet3 proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010). The Sss1/Sec61γ protein (80aas) has two domains. The cytosolic domain is required for Sec61p interaction while the transmembrane clamp domain is required to complete activation of the translocon after precursor targeting to Sec61p (Wilkinson et al., 2010). However, the apolar surfrace area determines the efficiency of translocon-mediated membrane-protein integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (Öjemalm et al., 2011). The essential Sec62, Sec63 and non-essential Sec66 and Sec72 proteins may comprise an SRP-independent tetrameric translocon enlisting the lumenal chaperone, BiP/Kar2 to """"ratchet"""" its substrates into the ER (Feldheim and Schekman 1994; Ast et al. 2013). Cytosolic segments of the Sec61 complex important for promoting the structural transition between the closed and open conformations of the complex have been identified (Mandon et al. 2018). Positively charged residues in multiple cytosolic segments, as well as bulky hydrophobic residues in the L6/7-TMS7 junction may be required for cotranslational translocation or integration of membrane proteins by the Sec61 complex (Mandon et al. 2018). The structure of the yeast post-translational Sec complex (Sec61-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72) by cryo-EM shows that Sec63 tightly associates with Sec61 through interactions in cytosolic, transmembrane, and ER-luminal domains, prying open Sec61's lateral gate and translocation pore, and thus activating the channel for substrate engagement.  Sec63 optimally positions binding sites for cytosolic and luminal chaperones in the complex to enable efficient polypeptide translocation (Itskanov and Park 2019). Further, post-translational translocation is mediated by the association of the Sec61 channel with the membrane protein complex, the Sec62-Sec63 complex, and substrates move through the channel by the luminal BiP ATPase. Wu et al. 2019 determined the cryoEM structure of the S. cerevisiae Sec complex, consisting of the Sec61 channel and the Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 proteins. Sec63 causes wide opening of the lateral gate of the Sec61 channel, priming it for the passage of low-hydrophobicity signal sequences into the lipid phase, without displacing the channel's plug domain. Lateral channel opening is triggered by Sec63 interacting both with cytosolic loops in the C-terminal half of Sec61 and transmembrane segments in the N-terminal half of the Sec61 channel. The cytosolic Brl domain of Sec63 blocks ribosome binding to the channel and recruits Sec71 and Sec72, positioning them for the capture of polypeptides associated with cytosolic Hsp70. The structure thus shows how the Sec61 channel is activated for post-translational protein translocation (Wu et al. 2019).  Multiple proteins that are normally upregulated in conditions similar to those encountered during infection, including several needed for cryptococcal virulence, are no longer increased. Sbh1 thereby regulates the ability of important fungal pathogens to cause disease (Santiago-Tirado et al. 2023)."	Yeast

3.A.5.9.1	"Sec-SRP translocase complex. The BAP29 and BAP31 (also called BCAP31) proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010).  SRP68 and SRP72 form a complex with SRP RNA and SRP19.  The SRP68 binding site for the RNA is a tetratricopeptide-like module that bends the RNA and inserts an arginine-rich helix into the major groove to open the conserved 5f RNA loop and remodel the RNA for protein translocation (Grotwinkel et al. 2014).  Sec31 (Sec 31L1; HSPC334; HSPC275) is an outer cage component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) machinery
which is recruited to specialized regions of the ER, called ER exit sites (ERES), where it plays a central
role in the early secretory pathway. Sec31 also interacts with ALG-2 (Programed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6)) and annexin A11 (AnxA11) (Shibata et al. 2015). The Sec61 translocon mediates poorly efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TMSs, but a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent that a hydrophobic TMS with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a membrane (Ulmschneider et al. 2017). Mycolactone is a bacterium-derived macrolide that blocks the biogenesis of a large array of secretory and integral transmembrane proteins through potent inhibition of the Sec61 translocon (Morel et al. 2018). The Sec61α subunit possesses an opening between TMS2b and TMS7, the lateral gate, that is  the exit for signal sequences and TMSs of translocating polypeptides to the lipid bilayer (Kida and Sakaguchi 2018). BCAP31 (BAP31; 246 aas and 3 N-terminal TMSs) is an ER chaparone that plays a role in the export of secreted proteins in
 the ER as well as the recognition of abnormally folded protein for 
targeting to the ER associated-degradation (ERAD) pathway (Wakana et al. 2008). It also serves as a 
cargo receptor for the export of transmembrane proteins (Annaert et al. 1997). Sec61 is the target of the cytotoxic plant-derived compound, ipomoeassin F (see TC family 8.C.10).Two accessory proteins of the Sec system are TRAP1 (of humans) and TRAM1 (of mice) (Shao 2023). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein synthesis, folding, and maturation in eukaryotic cells, responsible for production of secretory proteins and most integral membrane proteins. The universally conserved protein-conducting channel Sec61 complex mediates core steps in these processes by translocating hydrophilic polypeptide segments of client proteins across the ER membrane and integrating hydrophobic transmembrane segments into the membrane. The Sec61 complex associates with several other molecular machines and enzymes to enable substrate engagement with the channel and coordination of protein translocation with translation, protein folding, and/or post-translational modifications. Cryo-EM and functional studies have advanced our mechanistic understanding of Sec61-dependent protein biogenesis at the ER. Itskanov and Park 2022 reviewed current models for how Sec61 performs its functions in coordination with partner complexes. The SEC62 gene plays a role in dermato-oncology (Linxweiler and Müller 2022). The dynamic ribosome-translocon complex, which resides at the ER membrane, produces most of the human proteome. It governs the synthesis, translocation, membrane insertion, N-glycosylation, folding and disulfide-bond formation of nascent proteins. Gemmer et al. 2023  identified a pre-translocation intermediate with eukaryotic elongation factor 1a (eEF1a) in an extended conformation, suggesting that eEF1a may remain associated with the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis during proofreading. At the ER membrane, distinct polysomes bind to different ER translocons specialized in the synthesis of proteins with signal peptides or multipass TMSs with the translocon-associated protein complex (TRAP) present in both. The near-complete atomic model of the most abundant ER translocon variant, comprising the protein-conducting channel SEC61, TRAP and the oligosaccharyltransferase complex A (OSTA) revealed specific interactions of TRAP with other translocon components. Stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric cofactors associated with OSTA were determined (Gemmer et al. 2023). Mycolactone B (not A) is an exotoxin produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans that causes the tropical skin disease, Buruli ulcer (Nguyen et al. 2023). This toxin inhibits the Sec61 translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing the host cell from producing many secretory and transmembrane proteins. This results in cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. Isomer B's unique cytotoxicity is a consequence of both increased localization to the ER membrane and direct channel-locking association with the Sec61 translocon (Nguyen et al. 2023). To elucidate  redundancies in the components for the targeting of membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or their insertion into the ER membrane under physiological conditions, Jung and Zimmermann 2023 analyzed different human cells by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. The HeLa and HEK293 cells had been depleted of a certain component by siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 treatment or were deficient patient fibroblasts and compared to the respective control cells by differential protein abundance analysis. In addition to clients of the SRP and Sec61 complex, the authors identified membrane protein clients of components of the TRC/GET, SND, and PEX3 pathways for ER targeting, and Sec62, Sec63, TRAM1, and TRAP as putative auxiliary components of the Sec61 complex (Jung and Zimmermann 2023).  Most membrane proteins are synthesized on ER-bound ribosomes docked at the translocon. Sundaram et al. 2022 defined the composition, function and assembly of a translocon specialized for multipass membrane protein biogenesis. This 'multipass translocon' is distinguished by three components that selectively bind the ribosome-Sec61 complex during multipass protein synthesis: the GET- and EMC-like (GEL), protein associated with translocon (PAT) and back of Sec61 (BOS) complexes. Analysis of insertion intermediates revealed how features of the nascent chain trigger multipass translocon assembly. Reconstitution studies demonstrate a role for multipass translocon components in protein topogenesis, and cells lacking these components show reduced multipass protein stability, suggesting the mechanism by which nascent multipass proteins selectively recruit the multipass translocon to facilitate their biogenesis. They define the ER translocon as a dynamic assembly whose subunit composition adjusts co-translationally to accommodate the biosynthetic needs of its diverse range of substrates (Sundaram et al. 2022).  Intrinsically disordered region-mediated condensation of IFN-inducible SCOTIN/SHISA-5 inhibits ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport (Kim et al. 2023). The authors propose that SCOTIN impedes the ER-to-Golgi transport through its ability to form biomolecular condensates at the ER membrane."	Animals

3.D.5.1.1	"Na+-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, NqrABCDEF (Steuber et al. 2014).  Evolution of the Na+-NQR complex
may have involved functional divergence from its RNF homologue (3.D.6) following duplication of the rnf operon, loss of the rnfB gene and the recruitment of the reductase subunit of an aromatic monooxygenase.  Two additional proteins, ApbE and NqrM (DUF539), are essential for 
activity. ApbE is responsible for covalent attachment of flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN) while NqrM (D0WX40) is necessary for biogenesis (Kostyrko et al. 2016).  NqrM has an N-terminal TMS and four cysteyl residues that are essential for full activity (Kostyrko et al. 2016). The 3D structure of NQR reveals a
transmembrane channel in subunit NqrB. Toulouse et al. 2016;  proposed that partial uncoupling of the Vibrio cholerae NQR observed
with Li+, or with Na+ at pH 7.5 - 8.0, is caused by the backflow of the coupling cation
through the channel in NqrB (Toulouse et al. 2016). A ubiquinone binding is present in subunit B at the interface between subunits B and D (Tuz et al. 2017). In Vibrio cholerae, the mechanism of the homologous system involves conformational coupling of redox-driven Na+-translocation has been studied (Hau et al. 2023).  Ion pumping in Na+-NQR
 is driven by large conformational changes coupling electron transfer to
 ion translocation. We have determined a series of cryo-EM and X-ray 
structures of the Na+-NQR that represent snapshots of the catalytic cycle. The six subunits NqrA, B, C, D, E, and F of Na+-NQR
 harbor a unique set of cofactors that shuttle the electrons from NADH 
twice across the membrane to quinone. The redox state of a unique 
intramembranous [2Fe-2S] cluster orchestrates the movements of subunit 
NqrC, which acts as an electron transfer switch. The authors propose that this 
switching movement controls the release of Na+ from a binding site localized in subunit NqrB (Hau et al. 2023)."	Bacteria

2.A.6.1.4	"Cu+ /Ag+  efflux pump, CusABCF (may pump ions from the periplasm to the external medium); CusF is a periplasmic Cu+ /Ag+  binding receptor essential for full resistance (Franke et al., 2003). Bagai et al. (2007) reported that CusB (MFP) binds one molecule of Ag+  or Cu+  via four conserved methionines and induces a substrate-linked conformational change (Bagai et al., 2007). The crystal structures of CusB are available (Su et al., 2009). The crystal structure of the CusAB complex has been solved (PDB# 3K07) (Su et al., 2011a). CusC is listed under TC# 1.B.17.3.5. The metal-binding methionines play a role in restricting the substrates to monovalent heavy metals (Conroy et al., 2010). It has been reported to export L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). Crystal structures of the CusA efflux pump suggested that methionine residues in a 3-methionine cluster, bind the metal as a transport intermediate (Long et al., 2010). Four methionine pairs in the transmembrane region, and one in the periplasmic domain may comprise the channel. Cu+  is exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic chaparone, CusF in the extracellular space (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2014). The Cus efflux system removes Cu+ and Ag+ from both the cell cytoplasm and the periplasm (Su et al., 2011b; Delmar et al. 2014). Metal-bound CusB is required for activation of Cu+ transfer from
 CusF directly to a site in the CusA antiporter (Chacón et al. 2014). Metal transfer occurs between 
CusF and apo-CusB, and when metal-loaded, CusB plays a role in the
 regulation of metal ion transfer from CusF to CusA in the periplasm.  The ratio of CusA (RND):CusB (MFP):CusC (OMF) is 3:6:3 (Delmar et al. 2013). Intermediates in metal transfer reactions have been measured (Chacón et al. 2018)."	Gram-negative bacteria

Drug resistance depends on the simultaneous presence of all three proteins (Baranova and Nikaido, 2002). (Also contributes to copper and zinc resistance; regulation is mediated by BaeSR, and indole, Cu2+  and Zn2+  induce (Nishino et al., 2007)). MdtB:C stoichiometry = 2:1; MdtB and MdtC may play different roles (Kim et al., 2010), MdtB transporting the proton and MdtC transporting the drug (Kim and Nikaido 2012).  MdtBC is reported to export bile salts without MdtA (Nagakubo et al. 2002), but this conclusion seems questionable.

2.A.6.2.15	"Multidrug efflux pump, MexCD-OprJ (exports β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, macrolides, chloramphenicol, biocides, including levofloxacin, carbenicillin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefoperazone, piperacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, etc.; Mao et al., 2002).  Functions with MexC (MFP) and OprJ (OMF) as indicated above (Mao et al., 2002; Poole, 2008; Lorusso et al. 2022). MexCD-OprJ is one of four primary drug exporters in P. aeruginosa (Lorusso et al. 2022). Collateral sensitivity (CS) is an evolutionary trade-off traditionally 
linked to the mutational acquisition of antibiotic resistance (AR) (Hernando-Amado et al. 2023). 
However, AR can be temporally induced. Mutational 
acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance leads to robust CS to tobramycin
 in pre-existing antibiotic-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 Further, the strength of this phenotype is higher when nfxB mutants, 
over-producing the efflux pump MexCD-OprJ, are selected. Hernando-Amado et al. 2023 induced
 transient nfxB-mediated ciprofloxacin resistance by using the 
antiseptic dequalinium chloride. Notably, non-inherited induction of AR 
renders transient tobramycin CS in the analyzed antibiotic-resistant 
mutants and clinical isolates, including tobramycin-resistant isolates. 
Further, by combining tobramycin with dequalinium chloride we drive 
these strains to extinction. Our results support that transient CS could
 allow the design of new evolutionary strategies to tackle 
antibiotic-resistant infections, avoiding the acquisition of AR 
mutations on which inherited CS depends (Hernando-Amado et al. 2023). The type of quinolone resistance mechanism is related to the frequency of
 MDRP and the risk of MDRP incidence is highly dependent on the 
order of exposure to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (Yasuda et al. 2023)."	Bacteria

2.A.6.2.19	The multidrug efflux pump, EefABC (exports chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and doxycycline) (Masi et al., 2005). EefC exhibits low ionic selectivity (Masi et al., 2007).	Bacteria
2.A.6.2.2	"Multidrug/dye/detergent/bile salt/organic solvent resistance pump (substrates include: chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones, lipophilic β-lactams, norfloxacin, doxorubicin, novobiocin, rifampin, trimethoprim, acriflavin, crystal violet, ethidium, disinfectants, rhodamine-6G, TPP, benzalkonium, SDS, Triton X-100, deoxycholate/bile salts/organic solvents (alkanes), growth inhibitory steroid hormones (estradiola and progesterone), and phospholipids) (Elkins and Mullis, 2006). Lateral entry of substrates from the lipid bilayer into AcrB and its homologues has been proposed (Yu et al., 2003a; 2003b). [An asymmetric trimeric structure is established with AcrA having a hexameric structure, and TolC having a trimeric structure (Seeger et al., 2006]. A structure of a complex with YajC is also known (Törnroth-Horsefield et al., 2007). A covalently linked trimer of AcrB provides evidence for a peristaltic pump, alternative access, rotation mechanism (Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2009;Nikaido and Takatsuka, 2009; Pos, 2009) Further evidence for a rotatory mechanisms stems from kinetic analyses for cephalosporin efflux which can exhibit positive cooperativity (Nagano and Nikaido, 2009). May also export signaling molecules for cell-cell communication (Yang et al., 2006). The substrates may be captured in the lower cleft region of AcrB, then transported through the binding pocket, the gate, and finally to the AcrA funnel that connects AcrB to TolC (Husain & Nikaido et al., 2010).  AcrB has been converted into a light-driven proton pump using delta-rhodopsin (dR) linked to AcrB via a glycophorin A transmembrane domain. This created a
solar powered protein capable of selectively capturing antibiotics from bulk solutions (Kapoor and Wendell 2013).  The trimeric structure is essential for activity (Ye et al. 2014).  Association with AcrZ (TC# 8.A.50), a small 1 TMS protein (49 aas) that modifies the substrate specificity of AcrAB, has been demonstrated (Hobbs et al. 2012).  In a similar way, the binding of YajC to AcrB stimulates the export of ampicillin (Törnroth-Horsefield et al. 2007). AcrZ binds to
AcrB in a concave surface of the transmembrane domain (Du et al. 2015).  Substrate binding accelerates conformational transitions and substrate dissociation, demonstrating cooperativity (Wang et al. 2015). The overall structure of AcrAB-TolC exemplifies
the adaptor bridging model, wherein the funnel-like AcrA hexamer forms an intermeshing cogwheel
interaction with the alpha-barrel tip region of TolC. Direct interaction between AcrB and TolC
is not allowed (Kim et al. 2015).  TMS2 in AcrB is required for lipophilic carboxylate binding. A groove shaped by the interface between TMS1 and TMS2 specifically binds fusidic acid and other lipophilic
carboxylated drugs (Oswald et al. 2016). After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i.e., Asp407 or Asp408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys940 and Thr978, and this may initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion (Su et al. 2006). His978 is probably on the H+ pathway (Takatsuka and Nikaido 2006). AcrAB-TolC segregates to the old pole following cell division, causing the two daughter cells to exhibit different drug resistances (Bergmiller et al. 2017). The hoisting-loop is a highly flexible hinge that enables conformational energy transmission (Zwama et al. 2017). AcrB exhibits three distinct conformational states in the transport cycle, substrate access, binding, and extrusion, or loose (L), tight (T), and open (O) states, respectively (Yue et al. 2017). Simulations show that both Asp407 and Asp408 are deprotonated in the L/T states, while only Asp408 is protonated in the O state. Release of a proton from Asp408 in the O state results in large conformational changes.  Simulations offer dynamic details of how proton release drives the O-to-L transition in AcrB (Yue et al. 2017).  The three-dimensional structures of the homo-trimer complexes of AcrB-like transporters, and a three-step functional rotation helps to explain the mechanism of transport, but a more comprehensive model has been proposed (Zhang et al. 2017). Preparation of the trimeric complex (AcrAB/TolC) for cryo EM has been described (Du et al. 2018). The structural and energetic basis behind coupling functional rotation to proton translocation has been presented (Matsunaga et al. 2018). Protonation of  transmembrane Asp408 in the drug-bound protomer drives rotation. The conformational pathway identifies vertical shear motions among several transmembrane helices, which regulate alternate access of water as well as peristaltic motions that pump drugs into the periplasm (Matsunaga et al. 2018). CryoEM of detergent-free AcrB preserves lipid-protein interactions for visualization and reveals how the lipids pack against the protein (Qiu et al. 2018). In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance 
acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it 
reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can 
thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after 
plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve 
resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of 
antibiotics with other modes of action (Nolivos et al. 2019). Multiple transport pathways within AcrB are tuned to substrate physicochemical properties related to the polyspecificity of the pump (Tam et al. 2019). The cryoEM structure of AcrB in an artificial membrane at 3.9 Å resolution has been solved (Yao et al. 2020). The indole-dependent transport mechanism has been examined (Jewel et al. 2020). AcrB subunits rimerize to form the minimal functional unit, stabilized noncovalently by helix-helix interactions between TMS 1 and TMS 8. Peptides resembling these two TMSs inhibit subunit associations and drug export activity (Jesin et al. 2020). AcrB cycles between three functionally interdependent protomers through the loose (L), tight (T) and open (O) states during cooperative catalysis. Tam et al. 2021 presented 13 X-ray structures of AcrB in intermediate states of the transport cycle. Structure-based mutational analysis combined with drug susceptibility assays indicated that drugs are guided through dedicated transport channels toward the drug binding pockets. A co-structure obtained in the combined presence of erythromycin, linezolid, oxacillin and fusidic acid showed binding of fusidic acid deeply inside the T protomer transmembrane domain. Thiol cross-link substrate protection assays indicated that this transmembrane domain-binding site can also accommodate oxacillin or novobiocin but not erythromycin or linezolid. AcrB-mediated drug transport is suggested to be allosterically modulated in the presence of multiple drugs (Tam et al. 2021). Phenylalanine-arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN) is an inhibitor of efflux pumps, including AcrAB, in Gram-negative bacteria (Al-Marzooq et al. 2023). Acacia senegal budmunchiamines are adjuvants for rejuvenating phenicol activities towards Escherichia coli-AcrAB-mediated  drug resistant strains (Dofini Magnini et al. 2023). Pyridylpiperazine-based inhibitors of AcrAB have been characterized (Plé et al. 2022). Comparative reassessment of AcrB efflux inhibitors reveals differential impact of specific pump mutations on the activity of potent compounds (Schuster et al. 2024)."	Proteobacteria

A single AdeB protomer can simultaneously anchor a number of ethidium ligands, and different AdeB protomers can bind ethidium molecules simultaneously.

suggesting it may influence the specificity of drug export (Hobbs et al. 2012; Du et al. 2015). K. pneumoniae TolC plays a role in resistance towards most antibiotics, suggesting that it interacts
with the AcrAB efflux pump (Iyer et al. 2019). Expression as well as missense mutations in the crrB gene promotes resistance to odilorhabdin class compounds including NOSO-502 (Pantel et al. 2021). A pyridylpiperazine efflux pump inhibitor, BDM91288, boosts in vivo antibiotic efficacy against K. pneumoniae.  Using cryo-EM, BDM91288 binding to the transmembrane region of K. pneumoniae AcrB was dwmostrated, validating the mechanism of action of this inhibitor. Oral administration of BDM91288 significantly potentiated the in vivo efficacy of levofloxacin treatment in a murine model of K. pneumoniae lung infection (Vieira Da Cruz et al. 2024)."

vertical tunnel extending down contiguously from the outer membrane surface to the periplasmic end in the open conformational state of this channel (Lei et al. 2014). Coordination of substrate binding and protonation in MtrD controls the functionally rotating transport mechanism (Fairweather et al. 2021). The amino acyl sequence, N917-P927, plays a key role in modulating substrate access to the binding cleft and influences the overall orientation of the protein within the inner membrane necessary for optimal functioning (Chitsaz et al. 2021)."

2.A.6.4.1	"The secretory accessory proteins, SecDF. The first periplasmic domain of SecDF has been crystallized (Echizen et al., 2011) as has the intact SecDF complex (Tsukazaki and Nureki 2011). SecDF has been reported to function as a pmf-driven H+ transporter that facilitates protein translocation (Tsukazaki et al. 2011).  It may assume at least two conformations
differing by a 120 degrees rotation during polypeptide translocation (Mio et al. 2014). SecDF is proposed to undergo repeated conformational transitions to pull
 out the precursor protein from the SecYEG channel into the periplasm (Tsukazaki 2018). 
Once SecDF captures the precursor protein on the periplasmic surface, it can complete protein translocation even if SecA function is 
inactivated by ATP depletion, implying that SecDF is a 
protein-translocation motor that works independent of SecA. Structural 
and functional analyses of SecDF suggested that SecDF utilizes 
the proton gradient and interacts with precursor proteins in the flexible
 periplasmic region. The crystal structures of SecDF in different states
 at more than 3 Å resolution were reported in 2017 and 2018, which

SecDF also undergoes functionally important conformational changes that involve mainly its P1-head domain, and these changes are coupled with the proton motive force (Δpmf). Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with umbrella sampling, Ficici et al. 2017 studied the P1-head conformational change and how it is coupled to the pmf. They reported potentials of mean force along a root-mean-square-distance-based reaction coordinate obtained in the presence and absence of the TM electrical potential. Their results showed that the interaction of the P1 domain dipole moment with the TM electrical field lowers the free-energy barrier in the direction of the F-form to I-form transition, two conformations that vary by the relative positioning of the P1-head 
subdomain—the large periplasmic domain of TtSecDF—which is suggested to

A 12 TMS topology has been suggested (Belardinelli and Jackson 2017). Mycobacterial membrane protein Large 3 (MmpL3) is a promising drug target because its activity is essential and required for cell-wall biosynthesis. Several classes of MmpL3 inhibitors have been developed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with potent anti-TB activity, one of which is the drug candidate SQ109. Yang et al. 2020 have determined crystal structures of MmpL3 in complex with 
NITD-349 and SPIRO. Both inhibitors bind deep in the central channel of 
the transmembrane (TM) domain and cause conformational changes to the 
protein. The amide nitrogen and indole nitrogen of NITD-349 and the 
piperidine nitrogen of SPIRO interact and clamp Asp645. Analysis of the two structures reveals that these inhibitors target the 
proton relay pathway to block the activity of MmpL3 (Yang et al. 2020)."	Actinobacteria
2.A.6.5.6	"The mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) (Rv0206; 944 aas) may function with MmpL11 (TC# 2.A.6.5.5) (Tullius et al., 2011). MmpL3 exports trehalose monomycolate (TMM), involved in mycolic acid donation to the cell wall core (Tahlan et al., 2012). SQ109, a 1,2,-diamine related to ethambutol  is an inhibitor of MmpL3 (Tahlan et al., 2012).  The system may also transport heme.  Inhibitors have been identified (Rayasam 2013; Li et al. 2014).  MmpL3 has been shown to be a homotrimer of three 12 TMS subunits, confirming its RND-type structure (Belardinelli et al. 2016).  MmpL3 is a flipppase for mycolic acids, transporting them from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to the external side. A 1.5-diarylpyrrole compound, BM212, is a potent inhibitor (Xu et al. 2017). Inactivation of the mmpL3 gene in M. neoaurum increased the permeability of the outer membrane and allowed increased uptake of sterols for coversion to other sterols for industrial purposes. One such product is 22-hydroxy-23,24-bisnorchol-4-ene-3-one (4-HBC), used for the synthesis of various steroids in the industry (Xiong et al. 2017). Since iron deprivation decreases expression of the mmpL3 gene, a metal chelation strategy could boost the effectiveness of current anti-TB drug regimes to combat drug resistant TB (Pal et al. 2018). Crystal structures are available for MmpL3 alone and in complex with four TB drug candidates. MmpL3 consists of a periplasmic pore domain and a twelve-helix transmembrane domain. Two Asp-Tyr pairs centrally located in this domain appear to facilitate proton-translocation. SQ109, AU1235, ICA38, and rimonabant bind inside the transmembrane region and disrupt these Asp-Tyr pairs (Zhang et al. 2019). MmpL3 can be directly inhibited by several antitubercular compounds (Li et al. 2019). Yang et al. 2020 have determined crystal structures of MmpL3 in complex with 
NITD-349 and SPIRO. Both inhibitors bind deep in the central channel of 
the transmembrane (TM) domain and cause conformational changes to the 
protein. The amide nitrogen and indole nitrogen of NITD-349 and the 
piperidine nitrogen of SPIRO interact and clamp Asp645. Analysis of the two structures reveals that these inhibitors target the 
proton relay pathway to block the activity of MmpL3 (Yang et al. 2020). The  (MmpL3) transporter is required for shuttling the lipid trehalose monomycolate (TMM), a precursor of mycolic acid (MA)-containing trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP), in Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. It  facilitates the transport of fatty acids and lipidic elements to the mycobacterial cell wall. Su et al. 2021 reported 7 structures of the M. smegmatis MmpL3 transporter in its unbound state and in complex with trehalose 6-decanoate (T6D) or TMM using single-particle cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Combined with calculated results from molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD simulations, they revealed a lipid transport mechanism that involves a coupled movement of the periplasmic domain and transmembrane helices of the MmpL3 transporter that facilitates the shuttling of lipids to the mycobacterial cell wall (Su et al. 2021). Antibacterial compounds that target MmpL3 called ST004, have been identified and studied, showing that this compound strongly inhibits growth, and the cryoEM structure of MmpL3 with ST004 bound has been determined (Hu et al. 2022). PgfA (MSMEG_0317; TC# 1.B.163.1.9), a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, is a key determinant of polar growth and cell envelope composition 
in mycobacteria, and the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein 
to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of 
cellular asymmetry (Gupta et al. 2022). Mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) is an essential mycolic 
acid and lipid transporter required for growth and cell viability, and its function and inhibition have been reviewed (Williams and Abramovitch 2023). A continuous water pathway through the transmembrane region has been proposed, illustrating a putative pathway for protons. TMM can diffuse from 
the membrane into a binding pocket in MmpL3 spontaneously. Acetylation of TMM, which is required for transport, makes it more
 stable within MmpL3's periplasmic cavity compared to the unacetylated 
form (Li et al. 2023).  Equilibrium simulations revealed that trehalose monosmycolate can diffuse from the membrane into a binding pocket in MmpL3 spontaneously. Acetylation of TMM, which is required for transport, makes it more stable within MmpL3's periplasmic cavity (Li et al. 2023). Consistent with the close-open motion of the two PD domains, TMM entry 
size changes in the apo system, likely loading and moving the TMM, but 
it does not vary much in the holo system and probably impairs the movement 
of the TMM (Carbone et al. 2023). Water molecules passed through
 the central channel of the MmpL3 transporter to the cytoplasmic side in
 the apo system but not in the holo system, with a mean passing time of 
∼135 ns. Because water wires play an essential role in transporting 
protons, these findings shed light on the importance of the PMF in driving the
 close-open motion of the two TMSs. The key channel
 residues involved in water passage display considerable overlap with 
conserved residues within the MmpL protein family, supporting their 
critical functional role (Carbone et al. 2023). The  inhibitory mechanism of anti-TB drug SQ109 involves the allosteric inhibition of TMM translocation by MmpL3 (Carbone et al. 2023)."	Bacteria

2.A.6.6.1	"Niemann-Pick C1 (SLC65A1) and C2 disease proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, together may form a lipid/cholesterol exporter from lysosomes to other cellular sites including the plasma membrane (Sleat et al., 2004; Kennedy et al. 2014). NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency causes lysosomal retention of cholesterol, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids as well as neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Infante et al. 2008a). Cholesterol binds to the sterol-sensing domain (Ohgami et al. 2004). Increased mitochondrial cholesterol, observed in NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency, causes oxidative stress and increased rates of glycolysis and lactate release (Kennedy et al. 2014).  NPC1 binds cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and various oxysterols (Infante et al. 2008b; 
Liu et al., 2009 ). Soluble NPC2 binds cholesterol, and then passes it to the N-terminal domain of membranous NPC1 (Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009). Cholesterol trafficking in Niemann-Pick C-deficient cells was reviewed by Peake and Vance (2010). NPC1 is a late-endosomal membrane protein involved in trafficking of LDL-
derived cholesterol, Niemann-Pick disease type C, and Ebola virus infection.  It is the Ebola virus receptor. It contains 13 TMSs, five of which are thought to represent a ""sterol-sensing domain"", also present in other key regulatory proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake,
and signaling. A
crystal structure of a large fragment of human NPC1 at 3.6 Å resolution revealed internal
twofold pseudosymmetry along TMSs 2-13 and two structurally homologous domains that protrude 60 Å into
the endosomal lumen (Li et al. 2016). NPC1's sterol sensing domain forms a cavity that is accessible from both the luminal
bilayer leaflet and the endosomal lumen; this cavity is large
enough to accommodate one cholesterol molecule. A model was proposed for  cholesterol
sensing and transport (Li et al. 2016).  Lysosomal cholesterol activates TORC1 via an SLC38A9-Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex (Castellano et al. 2017).  Gong et al. 2016 presented a 4.4 Å structure of the full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution
 reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) 
of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. 
NPC1 contains three distinct lumenal
 domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMSs 2-13 exhibit a typical RND fold, among which TMSs 3-7 constitute
 the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in 
cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one 
NPC1 monomer through domain C (Gong et al. 2016). The effects of disease-causing mutations on quality control pathways involving the lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum, and how it functions to clear the most common mutant protein found in Niemann-Pick type C patients have been reviewed (Schultz et al. 2016). In the same review, knowledge concerning the mechanisms that degrade misfolded transmembrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is presented. Cholesterol esters are components of low density lipoprotein (LDL), 
which is brought into the cells of various tissues by targeted 
endocytosis. Within the endosomes, cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed, 
releasing free cholesterol, which is finally exported out of the 
endosome by NPC1 with assistance from a soluble protein NPC2 (Nikaido 2018). The transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half (the SSD, 
sterol-sensing domain) of NPC1 are homologous to the
sterol-binding domains of HMG-CoA reductase, as well as the regulator of
 cholesterol-regulated transcription activation, SCAP. The domain that binds cholesterol with the highest affinity, within NPC1, however, is the NTD. In the NPC2-NPC1 complex, the substrate is captured at a location far 
away from the membrane by NPC2, and then is brought to a location close 
to the membrane surface (NTD of NPC1), and is finally moved to the 
intramembranous region of NPC1. Degradation occurs via two pathways, the proteasome following MARCH6-dependent ERAD, and an autophagic pathway called the selective ER autophagy (ER-phagy) (Schultz et al. 2018). NPC1 exports LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes by carrying it through the 80 Å glycocalyx and the 40 Å lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx. Trinh et al. 2018 reconstituted cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport and showed that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. The locations of buried amino acids and docking studies have identified putative lipid binding domains that are in close proximity to amino acids that, when mutated, are connected to NPC1 loss-of-function (Elghobashi-Meinhardt 2019). Niemann-Pick type C 1 function requires lumenal domain residues that mediate cholesterol-dependent NPC2 binding, and lysosomal cholesterol egress requires both NPC1 and NPC2. Qian et al. 2020 presented systematic structural characterizations that revealed the molecular basis for low-pH-dependent cholesterol delivery from NPC2 to the transmembrane domain of NPC1. At pH 8.0, similar structures of NPC1 were obtained in nanodiscs and in detergent. A tunnel connecting the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD) was unveiled. At pH 5.5, the NTD exhibits two conformations, suggesting the motion for cholesterol delivery to the tunnel. A cholesterol molecule was found at the membrane boundary of the tunnel, and TMS2 moves toward formation of a surface pocket on the SSD. The structure of the NPC1-NPC2 complex at 4.0 Å resolution was obtained at pH 5.5, elucidating the molecular basis for cholesterol handoff from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) (Qian et al. 2020). Genetic diversity in Niemann-Pick C1 can be managed through modulation of the Hsp70 chaperone system (Wang et al. 2020). The NPC1 protein is evolutionarily conserved with homologues reported in yeast to humans; NPC2 is present in C. elegans to humans. While neurons in mammalian models of NPC1 and NPC2 diseases exhibit many changes that are similar to those in humans (e.g., endosomal/lysosomal storage, Golgi fragmentation, neuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration), a reduced degree of ectopic dendritogenesis and an absence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in these species suggest important differences in the way lower mammalian neurons respond to NPC1/NPC2 loss of function (Walkley and Suzuki 2004). Cholesterol transport studies using wild-type NPC1 and the P691S mutant suggest changes in dynamical behavior as determined using molecular dynamics simulations  (Elghobashi-Meinhardt 2020). NPC1 mutations cause variable disease phenotypes (Musalkova et al. 2020). Filoviruses, including marburgviruses and ebolaviruses, have a single transmembrane glycoprotein (GP) that facilitates their entry into cells. During entry, GP needs to be cleaved by host proteases to expose the receptor-binding site that binds to the endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein. Crystal structural analyses of the cleaved GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus (EBOV) in complex with human NPC1 has shown that NPC1 has two protruding loops (loops 1 and 2), which engage a hydrophobic pocket on the head of EBOV GPcl (Igarashi et al. 2021). Cholesterol docking studies, focusing on binding recognition, showed differences in the binding positions of mutant variants versus the wild-type protein (Martínez-Archundia et al. 2020). Commonalities between Niemann-Pick C1 disease and other lysosomal storage disorders have been reviewed (Yañez et al. 2020). Cholesterol binding to the sterol-sensing region of the Niemann Pick C1 protein confines dynamics of its N-terminal domain (Dubey et al. 2020). Variants in the Niemann-Pick type C gene, NPC1, are probably not associated with Parkinson's disease (Ouled Amar Bencheikh et al. 2020). NPC1 exports low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. TMSs 3-7 of NPC1 comprise the Sterol-Sensing Domain (SSD). The anti-fungal drug itraconazole abolishes NPC1 activity in cells. Long et al. 2020 reported a cryo-EM structure of human NPC1 bound to itraconazole, which reveals how this binding site in the center of NPC1 blocks a putative lumenal tunnel linked to the SSD. Blocking this tunnel abolishes NPC1-mediated cholesterol egress. The palmitate anchor of Hedgehog occupies a similar site in the homologous tunnel of Patched, suggesting a conserved mechanism for sterol transport in this family of proteins and establishing a central function of their SSDs. Npc1, acting in neurons and glia, is essential for the formation and maintenance of CNS myelin (Yu and Lieberman 2013). In contrast to the benign Q92S mutation, Q92R reduces electrostatic potential around S-opening, and thus likely affects the NPC1 (NTD)-NPC2 interaction and/or cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1 (Petukh and Zhulin 2018). In the somatosensory neocortex, NPC1 plays a role in synaptic function (Avchalumov et al. 2012). Lysosomes receive extracellular and intracellular cholesterol and redistribute it throughout the cell. Cholesterol egress from lysosomes is critical for cholesterol homeostasis, and its failure underlies the pathogenesis of genetic disorders such as Niemann-Pick C disease. Anderson et al. 2022 reported that the BORC-ARL8-HOPS ensemble is required for egress of free cholesterol from lysosomes and for storage of esterified cholesterol in lipid droplets. Depletion of BORC, ARL8 or HOPS does not alter the localization of the lysosomal transmembrane cholesterol transporter NPC1 to degradative compartments, but decreases the association of the luminal transporter NPC2 and increases NPC2 secretion. BORC-ARL8-HOPS depletion also increases lysosomal degradation of CI-MPR, which normally sorts NPC2 to the endosomal-lysosomal system and then is recycled to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). These defects likely result from impaired HOPS-dependent fusion of endosomal-lysosomal organelles and an uncharacterized function of HOPS in CI-MPR recycling. Thus, the BORC-ARL8-HOPS ensemble is required for cholesterol egress from lysosomes by enabling CI-MPR-dependent trafficking of NPC2 to the endosomal-lysosomal system (Anderson et al. 2022). Members of this familly have the NPC1 fold (Ferrada and Superti-Furga 2022). A synopsis of inborn errors in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism in the Niemann-Pick type diseases has appearred (Pfrieger 2023). Iron limitation restores autophagy and increases lifespan in the yeast model of Niemann-Pick type C1 (Martins et al. 2023).  The NPCs play a key role in the prognosis and diagnosis of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and may 
be an important indicator for LIHC prognosis and diagnosis; thus, NPC1 might 
be a potential therapeutic target in LIHC (Chen et al. 2023). Species-specific differences in NPC1 protein trafficking govern therapeutic responses in Niemann-Pick type C disease (Schultz et al. 2022)."	Animals

2.A.6.6.13	"Patched, PTCH1, Ptc1 or PTCH, SLC65 family) of 1447 aas and 12 TMSs.  RND transporter-like receptor, regulates the activity of Smoothened of 7 TMSs via the Hedgehog (HH) pathway. The Na+ gradient may provide the energy for Patched activity (Myers et al. 2017). Possibly Patched1, chemiosmotically driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient, regulates Smoothened. 3-d structures have been solved at ~ 3.5 Å resolution by cryoEM (Qi et al. 2018). This protein seems to have both transport and signalling functions, exporting cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the membrane out to the external environment. It displays a tunnel going through the membrane with a lateral opening, all large enough to accomodate cholesterol (Qi et al. 2018; Sommer and Lemmon 2018). The distrutribution of Smoothened on the primary cillium surface has been studied (Yoon et al. 2019).Hedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance by binding to and inactivating their common receptor Patched that suppresses the activity of the 7-TMS protein Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of Patched revealed striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters in whick a central hydrophobic conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting that Patched catalyzes cholesterol transport (Zhang et al. 2018). Cholesterol in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is reduced by PTCH1 expression but rapidly restored by Hedgehog stimulation, suggesting that PTCH1 regulates Smoothened by controlling cholesterol availability.Key proteins in the Hedgehog-signalling pathway dynamically localize in primary cilia, antenna-like solitary organelles present on most cells. The secreted Hedgehog ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) binds to its receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) in primary cilia, causing its inactivation and delocalization from cilia. At the same time, the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO or SMOH; TC# 9.A.14.16.4) is released of its inhibition by PTCH1 and accumulates in cilia. PTCH1 inactivation by SHH changes the diffusive motion of PTCH1 (Weiss et al. 2019). PTCH1 is mutated in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) (Nakase et al. 2020).
Patched (Ptc1) acts as a suppressor for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by depleting sterols in the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet that are required for the activation of downstream regulators. The positive modulator Hh inhibits Ptc1's transport function by binding to Ptc1 and its co-receptors, which are locally concentrated in invaginated microdomains known as caveolae. Luo et al. 2021 reconstituted the mouse Ptc1 into lipid nanodiscs and determined its structure by cryoEM. The structure is  similar to those in amphipol and detergents but displays various conformational differences in the transmembrane region. Although most particles are monomers, Ptc1 dimers were also observed with distinct interaction patterns and different membrane curvatures, some of which are reminiscent of caveolae. An extramembranous ""hand-shake"" region, rich in hydrophobic and aromatic residues, mediates inter-Ptc1 interactions under conditions of different membrane curvature, providing a plausible framework for Ptc1 clustering in the highly curved caveolae (Luo et al. 2021). Cholesterol regulates reception of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal in target cells. In vertebrates, cell-surface organelles called primary cilia function as compartments for the propagation of Hh signals. Various studies have led to the model that Patched-1 (PTCH1), the receptor for Hh ligands, uses its transporter-like activity to lower cholesterol accessibility in the membrane surrounding primary cilia (Kinnebrew et al. 2022). PTCH1 depletes accessible cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the membrane in a manner regulated by its ligand Sonic Hedgehog and the transmembrane potassium gradient. Kinnebrew et al. 2021 proposed that PTCH1 moves cholesterol from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane in exchange for potassium ion export. The transition between 'inward-open' and solvent 'occluded' states is accompanied by Na+ induced pinching of intracellular helical segments. Thus, the energetics and ion-coupling stoichiometries of PTCH1 transport mechanisms are revealed, whereby 1-3 Na+ or 2-3 K+ couple to cholesterol export, and provide a molecular description of transitions between distinct transport states (Ansell et al. 2023). PTCH1 inhibits the G protein-coupled receptor, Smoothened (SMO), via a debated mechanism involving modulation of ciliary cholesterol accessibility. There is an energetic barrier of ~15 to 20 kilojoules per mole for cholesterol export. The transition between ""inward-open"" and solvent ""occluded"" states is accompanied by Na+-induced pinching of intracellular helical segments. Thus, the findings illuminate the energetics and ion coupling stoichiometries of PTCH1 transport  (Ansell et al. 2023)."	PTCH1 of Homo sapiens

The cholesterol-sensing protein Scap induces cholesterol synthesis by transporting membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the theendoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic activation. Transport requires interaction between Scap's two ER luminal loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap's binding to Insig, an ER retention protein. Kober et al. 2021 used cryo-EM to elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol.  L1 and L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap. In the presence of Insig, this platform undergoes a large rotation accompanied by rearrangement of Scap's transmembrane helices. This conformational change may halt Scap transport of SREBPs and thereby inhibit cholesterol synthesis (Kober et al. 2021).	SCAP of Gallus gallus (Chicken)

2.A.6.6.3	"Yeast sterol transport system consisting of two proteins, NCR1 (YPL006w) and NPC2 (YDL046w), components of the Niemann-Pick Type C transporter. It drives sterol integration into the lysosomal membrane before redistributing them to other cellular membranes. Expression of yeast NP-C-related gene 1 (NCR1), the orthologue of the human NP-C gene 1 (NPC1) defective in the disease, in Chinese hamster ovary NPC1 mutant cells suppressed lipid accumulation (Malathi et al. 2004). Deletion of NCR1, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly residing in the vacuole of normal yeast, gave no phenotype. However, a dominant mutation in the putative sterol-sensing domain of Ncr1p conferred temperature and polyene antibiotic sensitivity without changes in sterol metabolism. Instead, the mutant cells were resistant to inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis and super sensitive to sphingosine and C2-ceramide. Plasma membrane sphingolipids accumulated and redistributed to the vacuole and other subcellular membranes of the mutant cells. Malathi et al. 2004 proposed that the primordial function of these proteins is to recycle sphingolipids, and that defects in this process in higher eukaryotes secondarily result in cholesterol accumulation. Winkler et al. 2019 presented a framework for sterol membrane integration. Sterols are transferred between hydrophobic pockets of vacuolar NPC2 and NCR1. NCR1 has its N-terminal domain (NTD) positioned to deliver a sterol to a tunnel connecting the NTD to the luminal membrane leaflet, 50 Å away. A sterol is caught inside this tunnel during transport, and a proton-relay network of charged residues in the transmembrane region is linked to this tunnel, supporting a proton-driven transport mechanism. Winkler et al. 2019 proposed a model for sterol integration that clarifies the role of these NPC proteins.

2.A.6.6.4	"SREBP cleavage-activating protein, Scap of 1279 aas.  Cholesterol homeostasis is mediated by Scap, a polytopic ER protein that transports SREBPs from ER
to Golgi where SREBPs are processed to forms that activate cholesterol synthesis. Scap has eight
transmembrane helices and two large luminal loops, designated Loop1 and Loop7. Evidence suggests that Loop1 binds to Loop7, allowing Scap to bind COPII proteins for transport in
coated vesicles (Zhang et al. 2016). When ER cholesterol rises, it binds to Loop1 causeing
dissociation from Loop7, abrogating COPII binding. Direct binding of the two
loops causes dissociation from the membrane, allowing the soluble
complex to be secreted.  Point mutations that disrupt the
Loop1-Loop7 interaction prevented secretion. The cryo-EM structure of human SCAP bound to Insig-2 suggests how their interaction is regulated by sterols (Yan et al. 2021). The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway controls 
cellular homeostasis of sterols. The key players in this pathway, Scap 
and Insig-1 and -2, are membrane-embedded sterol sensors. The 
25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC)-dependent association of Scap and Insig 
acts as the master switch for the SREBP pathway. Yan et al. 2021 presented

2.A.6.6.6	"Liver/intestinal enterocyte brush border Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1; SLC65A2) protein; responsible for ezetimibe-sensitive absorption of luminal lipids and cholesterol  as well as lutein via a transport mechanism (Altmann et al., 2004; Davies et al., 2005; Liscum, 2007, Dixit et al. 2007; Reboul 2013). NPC1L1-dependent sterol uptake seems to be a clathrin-mediated endocytic
 process and is regulated by cellular cholesterol content (Betters and Yu, 2010; Jia et al., 2011).  Dietary cholesterol induces trafficking of the intestinal NPC1L1 from the brush boarder to endosomes (Skov et al. 2011).  It distributes on the brush border membranes of 
enterocytes and the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. It is the target of ezetimibe, a hypocholesterolemic drug which blocks internalization of NPC1L1 and cholesterol in the mouse small intestine (Wang and Song 2012; Xie et al. 2012). Human NPC1L1 is a 1,332-amino acid protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain 
(SSD) that shows sequence homology to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), 
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). NPC1L1 may have evolved at two sites (apical
membrane of enterocytes and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes) to mediate cholesterol uptake
through a clathrin-mediated endocytic process, protecting the body against fecal and biliary loss of
cholesterol (Yu 2008). NPC1L1-dependent intestinal cholesterol absorption appears to require ganglioside GM3 in membrane microdomains (Nihei et al. 2018). Ezetimibe is the only inhibitor of NPC1L1 available for clinical use, but aminoss-lactam ezetimibe derivatives may also be effective (Pirillo et al. 2016). The cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, acts by blocking the sterol-induced internalization of NPC1L1 (Ge et al. 2008). Otopetrin 1 activation by purinergic nucleotides regulates intracellular calcium ions (Hughes et al. 2007). NPC1L1 plays a major role in the intestinal absorption of biliary cholesterol, vitamin E, and vitamin K. The drug ezetimibe inhibits NPC1L1-mediated absorption of cholesterol, lowering of circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Long et al. 2021 reported cryoEM structures of human NPC1L1 bound to either cholesterol or a lipid resembling vitamin E. The same intramolecular channel in hNPC1L1 mediates transport of vitamin E and cholesterol. hNPC1L1 exists primarily as a homodimer; dimerization is mediated by aromatic residues within a region of TMS 2 that exhibits a horizonal orientation in the membrane. Mutation of tryptophan-347, lieing in this region, disrupts dimerization, and the resultant monomeric NPC1L1 exhibits reduced efficiency of cholesterol uptake (Long et al. 2021)."	Animals

 Dispatched shows a typical RND protein folding pattern, although its

2.A.6.9.2	Protein dispatched homologue 1 (Dispatched-1, DispA, DISP1) of 1521 aas and 12 TMSs.  The human ortholog (Q96F81, 1524 aas) is 83% identical.  They play roles in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and associated pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) in humans and mice (Takahashi et al. 2018). Hedgehog (HH) signaling is essential for metazoan development. The HH ligand is secreted into the extracellular space by DISP1. Chen et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of human DISP1. It contains 12 TMSs and two extracellular domains (ECDs) like other RND homologs. Its ECDs reveal an open state, in contrast to its structural homologues PTCH1 and NPC1, whose extracellular/luminal domains adopt a closed state. The low-resolution structure of the DISP1 complex with dual lipid-modified HH ligand reveals how the ECDs of DISP1 engage with HH ligand. Several cholesterol-like molecules were found in the TMSs, implying a transport-like function of DISP1 (Chen et al. 2020). Dispatched enables tissue-patterning activity of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein by releasing it from tightly -localized sites of embryonic expression. Wang et al. 2021 determined a cryoEM structure of the mouse DISP1, revealing three Na+ ions coordinated within a channel that traverses its transmembrane domain. The rate of Hedgehog export is dependent on the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The transmembrane channel and Na+ binding are disrupted in DISP1-NNN, a variant with asparagine substitutions for three intramembrane aspartate residues that each coordinate and neutralize the charge of one of the three Na+ ions. DISP1-NNN and variants that disrupt single Na+ sites retain binding to, but are impaired in export of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein to the SCUBE2 acceptor. Interaction of the amino-terminal signalling domain of the Sonic hedgehog protein (ShhN) with DISP1 occurs via an extensive buried surface area and contacts with an extended furin-cleaved DISP1 arm. Variability analysis reveals that ShhN binding is restricted to one extreme of a continuous series of DISP1 conformations. The bound and unbound DISP1 conformations display distinct Na+-site occupancies, which suggests a mechanism by which transmembrane Na+ flux may power extraction of the lipid-linked Hedgehog signal from the membrane. Na+-coordinating residues in DISP1 are conserved in PTCH1 and other metazoan RND family members, suggesting that Na+ flux powers their conformationally driven activities (Wang et al. 2021). The substrate is probably the sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein of 462 aas and one N-terminal TMS.	Animals

 Transcription of the operon is induced by konjac glucomannan and 
requires the last mannanase gene (gmuG). Cellobiose and mannobiose, 
possible degradation products of glucomannan by GmuG, are strong 
inducers of transcription. An internal regulatory gene 
(gmuR) encodes a repressor of the operon, as disruption of this gene 
enhances transcription of the operon in the absence of inducers. The 
expression of the glucomannan utilizing operon is thus induced by degraded glucomannan products, and repressed by an internal repressor (Sadaie et al. 2008)."	GmuABC of Bacillus subtilisGmuA, IIA, 110 aas, O05506GmuB, IIB, 103 aas, O05505GmuC, IIC, 422 aas and 10 TMSs, O05507

1.A.112.1.1	Kidney metal (Mg2+) transporter, Cyclin (CNN) M2 isoform CRA_b (CNNM2). Defects cause hypomagnesemia. It has an extracellular N-terminus, an N-terminal TMS, a hydrophilic domain followed by 4 TMSs, another hydrophilic domain, and an intracellular C-terminus (de Baaij et al., 2012). CNNM2a forms heterodimers with the smaller isoform CNNM2b.  The human splice variant 1 of CNNM2 (ACDP2; Q9H8M5) is a Mg2+ transporter (Brandao et al. 2012).  The Bateman module is involved in AMP binding and Mg2+ sensing, and their binding causes a conformational change in the CBS module, transmitted to the transmembrane domain (Corral-Rodríguez et al. 2014). It may be able to transport divalent metal cations, Mg2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and monvalent cation, Na+. In prokaryotes, homologs are CorB/C.	Animals
1.A.112.1.2	Metal transporter CNNM3 (Ancient conserved domain-containing protein 3) (mACDP3) (Cyclin-M3) of 713 aas and probably 5 TMSs with one N-terminal, and four together in the first half of the protein (Chen et al. 2018). See the family description for the domain order of the CNNM proteins.	Animals

1.A.112.1.6	Putative Mg2+ exporter of 875 aas and 5 TMSs, CNNM2 or ACDP2 (Chen et al. 2018). The bacterial CorC is involved in resistance to antibiotic exposure and to the survival of pathogenic microorganisms in their host environments. CorC possesses a cytoplasmic region containing the (regulatory ?) ATP-binding site (Huang et al. 2021). An inhibitor, IGN95a, targets the ATP-binding site and blocks both ATP binding and Mg2+ export. The cytoplasmic domain structure in complex with IGN95a was determined (Huang et al. 2021). With ATP bound to the cytoplasmic domain, the conformational equilibrium of CorC shifts toward the inward-facing state of the transmembrane domain (Huang et al. 2021). These considerations suggest that CorC may be an ATP-driven Mg2+ efflux porter, and if so, the family belongs in TC sub-class, 3.A. CorC homologs may be able to export Mg2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Cu2+ and Fe2+.	CNNM2 of Homo sapiens

1.A.112.2.10	Magnesium and cobalt efflux protein, CorC or MpfA (Magnesium Protection Factor A) of 449 aas and 4 N-terminal TMSs, apparently in a 2 + 2 TMS arrangement. Evidence has been presented that this protein catalyzes active Mg2+ extrusion from the cell (Armitano et al. 2016).  If so, It must be an active transporter, either a secondary carrier (TC subclass 2.A) or an ATP hydrolysis-driven exporter (TC subclass 3.A).	MpfA of  Staphylococcus aureus
1.A.112.2.11	"PaeA, YtfL, UPF0053 inner membrane protein, Duf21 domain containing protein, HlyC/CorC family transporter, hemolysin homolog of 447 aas and 4 N-terminal TMSs (residues 1 - 200) followed by a large hydrophilic domain (cystathionine beta-synthase, CBS, residues 201 - 447), possibly with a single TMS at about residue 320. It transports cadaverine and putrescine.  In fact, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae (TC# 1.A.112.1.12) and E. coli synthesize, import, and export cadaverine, 
putrescine, and spermidine to maintain physiological levels of polyamines and provide 
pH homeostasis. Both low and high intracellular levels of polyamines 
confer pleiotropic phenotypes or lethality. Iwadate et al. 2021 demonstrated that PaeA (YtfL) is 
required for reducing cytoplasmic cadaverine and putrescine 
concentrations. PaeA is involved in stationary 
phase survival when cells are grown in acidic medium in 
which they produce cadaverine. The paeA mutant is sensitive to 
putrescine, but not spermidine or spermine. Sensitivity to external 
cadaverine in stationary phase is only observed at pH > 8, suggesting
 that the polyamines need to be deprotonated to passively diffuse into 
the cell. In the absence of PaeA, intracellular polyamine 
levels increase and the cells lose viability. Ectopic expression of 
the known cadaverine exporter, CadB, in stationary phase partially 
suppresses the paeA mutant phenotype, and overexpression of paeA in exponential
 phase partially complements a cadB mutant grown in acidic medium. Thus, PaeA is a cadaverine/putrescine 
exporter, reducing potentially toxic levels under certain stress 
conditions (Iwadate et al. 2021)."	PaeA of E. coli

Based on the E. coli ortholog, it probably transports putrescine and canavanine (Iwadate et al. 2021). Klebsiella pneumoniae is a source of widespread contamination of
 medical equipment, causing pneumonia as well as other multiorgan 
metastatic infections. During K. pneumoniae infections of lung epithelia, microtubules are severed and then eliminated, and YtfA plays a role, probably by secreting a relevant compound (Chua et al. 2019)."	YtfL of Klebsiella pneumoniae

9.A.2.1.2	"DabB2/DabA2 putative CO2 concentrating transporter, where DabB2 is a possible inorganic ion (H+ or Na+) transporter, homologous to integral membrane NADH dehydrogenase subunits, while DabA2 is homologous to carbonic anhydrases.  Bacterial autotrophs often rely on CO2 concentrating 
mechanisms (CCMs) to assimilate carbon. Desmarais et al. 2019 performed a genome-wide barcoded transposon screen to 
identify essential and CCM-related genes in the γ-proteobacterium 
Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. Screening revealed that the CCM comprises
 at least 17 and probably no more than 25 genes, most of which are 
encoded in 3 operons. Two of these operons (DAB1 and DAB2) contain a 
two-gene locus that encodes a domain of unknown function (Pfam: PF10070)
 and a putative cation transporter (Pfam: PF00361). Physiological and 
biochemical assays demonstrated that these proteins (named DabA 
and DabB for ""DABs accumulate bicarbonate"") - assemble into a heterodimeric 
complex that contains a putative β-carbonic anhydrase-like active site
 and functions as an energy-coupled inorganic carbon (Ci) 
pump. DAB operons are found in a diverse range of 
bacteria and archaea. Desmarais et al. 2019 demonstrated that functional DABs are present in
 the human pathogens, Bacillus anthracis and Vibrio cholerae. They proposed that DABs constitute a class of 
energized Ci pumps and play a critical role in the metabolism of Ci throughout prokaryotic phyla. Since the uptake of Ci is inhibited by the ionophore CCCP, DAB2 activity may be energetically coupled to a cation gradient, and as DabA2–DabB2 shows pH-independent rescue of carbonic anhydrase-free E. coli, CO2 is probably the transported substrate. Holthuijzen et al 1987 (DOI 10.1007/BF00463489) reported similar findings for Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, and (Menning et al. 2016) got similar results for Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus (Thiomicrospira crunogena). Both DAB operons in Halothiobacillus are required; each having an HCR phenotype when knocked out. A double deletion, which might be expected to have a more severe phenotype, was not constructed."

2.A.21.3.1	"Glucose or galactose:Na+ symporter, SGLT1 (galactose > glucose > fucose). Cotransports water against an osmotic gradient (Naftalin, 2008). SGLT1 harbors a water channel (Barta et al. 2022). TMS IV of the high-affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter participates in sugar binding (Liu et al., 2008) and also participates in the uptake of resveratrol, an anti atherosclerosis polyphenol (Chen et al. 2013).  hSGLT1 is expressed as a disulfide bridged homodimer via C355; a portion of the intracellular 12-13 loop is re-entrant and readily accessible from the
extracellular milieu (Sasseville et al. 2016). Possibly, the extracellular loop between TMS 12 and TMS 13 participates in the sugar transport of SGLT1 (Nagata and Hata 2006). SGLT1 also transports water efficiently. Calculation of the unitary water channel permeability, pf, yielded 
similar values for cell and proteoliposome experiments. The 
absence of glucose, Na+, a membrane potential in 
vesicles, or the directionality of water flow did not grossly altered the pf. Such 
a weak dependence on protein conformation indicates that a 
water-impermeable occluded state (glucose and Na+ in their binding 
pockets) lasts for only a minor fraction of the transport cycle or, 
alternatively, that occlusion of the substrate does not render the 
transporter water-impermeable (Erokhova et al. 2016). the ortholog from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) of 465 aas and 12 putative TMSs is 80% identical and is found in the anterior and mid intestine (Liang et al. 2020). Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 2 mediate intestinal transport of quercetrin (Li et al. 2020). Cardiac SGLT1 does not contribute appreciably to overall glucose uptake (Ferté et al. 2021). Collective domain motion facilitates water transport in SGLT1 (Sever and Merzel 2023).  Ferulic acid-grafted chitosan (FA-g-CS) stimulates the transmembrane transport of anthocyanins by SGLT1 and GLUT2 (Ma et al. 2022). SLC5A1 and SLC5A3 are involved in glioblastoma cell migration, thereby complementing the migration-associated transportome, suggesting that SLC inhibition may be a promising approach for treatment (Brosch et al. 2022). SGLT1 mediates the absorption of water, yet the mechanism and the effect of inhibitors is not well defined.  Sever and Merzel 2023 determined the influence of the energetic and dynamic properties of
 SGLT1 as they are influenced by selected sugar uptake inhibitors on 
water permeation. variants of Slc5A1 give rise to Congenital Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption (Hoşnut et al. 2023)."	Animals

2.A.21.3.16	"Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (Na+/glucose cotransporter 2; SGLT2) of 672 aas and 14 TMSs. It is a low affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter). It shows increased expression in human diabetic nephropathy. Inhibition causes decreased renal lipid accumulation, inflamation and disease symptoms (Wang et al. 2017). It has a Na+ to glucose coupling ratio of 1:1 (Brown et al. 2019). Efficient substrate transport in the mammalian kidney 
is provided by the concerted action of a low affinity high capacity and a
 high affinity low capacity Na+/glucose cotransporter arranged in series along kidney proximal tubules. Inhibitors are antidiabetic agents (Li 2019; Singh and Singh 2020). They are also useful as theraputic agents of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease (Kanbay et al. 2021). Marein, an active component of the Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt plant, ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting renal sodium
 glucose transporter 2 and activating the AMPK signaling pathway (Guo et al. 2020). NHE-3 (TC# 2.A.53.2.18) was markedly downregulated, while the Na+-HCO3--cotransporter (NBC-1; TC# 2.A.31.2.12) and SGLT2 were upregulated after kidney transplantation (Velic et al. 2004).
  Pharmacological inhibition of hSGLT2 by oral small-molecule 
inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, leads to enhanced excretion of 
glucose and is widely used in the clinic to manage blood glucose levels 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Niu et al. 2022 determined the cryoEM structure of the 
hSGLT2-MAP17 complex in the empagliflozin-bound state to a resolution of
 2.95 Å. MAP17 interacts with transmembrane helix 13 of hSGLT2. 
Empagliflozin occupies both the sugar-substrate-binding site and the 
external vestibule to lock hSGLT2 in an outward-open conformation, thus 
inhibiting the transport cycle (Niu et al. 2022 ). There is no upregulation regarding host factors potentially promoting 
SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells when the SGLT2-blocker 
empagliflozin, telmisartan and the DPP4-inhibitor blocker, linagliptin, 
are used (Xiong et al. 2022).  The effectiveness of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors on cardiorenal outcomes has been described (Ali et al. 2024)."	Animals

Loop 13, which is associated with phlorizin binding, is variable, as is the interaction with this inhibitor in various species. Immunoreaction was observed in the proximal tubular segments PIa and PIIa, the early distal tubule, and the collecting tubule. Thus, Leucoraja, in contrast to the mammalian kidney, employs only SGLT1 to reabsorb D-glucose in the early, as well as in the late segments of the proximal tubule and probably also in the late distal tubule. It differs from the kidney of the close relative, Squalus acanthias, which uses SGLT2 in more distal proximal tubular segments (Althoff et al. 2007). The ortholog in Squalus acanthias (Spiny dogfish), is 88% identical and has been characterized (Althoff et al. 2006).	Sglt1 of Leucoraja erinacea (Little skate) (Raja erinacea)

2.A.21.5.1	"Sodium iodide symporter, NIS (I-:Na+ = 1:2). It also transports other monovalent anions including: ClO3-, SCN-, SeCN-, NO3-, Br-, BF4-, IO4- and BrO3-. It mediates electroneutral active transport of the environmental pollutant perchlorate (Dohan et al., 2007) and inhibits I- uptake. The stoichometry of ClO4-:Na+ uptake is 1 to 1 as perchlorate binds both to the anion and one of the two cation binding sites (Llorente-Esteban et al. 2020). Five beta-OH group-containing residues (Thr-351, Ser-353, Thr-354,
Ser-356, and Thr-357) and Asn-360, all of which putatively face the same side of the helix in TMS
IX, plus Asp-369, located in the membrane/cytosol interface, play key roles in NIS function and seem
to be involved in Na+ binding/translocation (De la Vieja et al. 2007). Thr-354 is essential for iodide uptake (Tatsumi et al., 2010). The G39R mutant (congenital) is inactive. G93 is a pivot for the inwardly to outwardly conformational change (Paroder-Belenitsky et al., 2011).  The protein is present as a dimer (Huc-Brandt et al. 2011).  Functionally equivalent systems have been reviewed (Darrouzet et al. 2014). Mutations cause congenital I- transport defects (ITD; Li et al. 2013).  The physiological, medical and mechanistic features of NIS have been reviewed (Portulano et al. 2014). Mutations in TMS IX can give rise to hypothyroidism (Watanabe et al. 2018). NIS may also have a pump-independent, protumorigenic role in thyroid cancer via its cross-talk with PTEN signaling (Feng et al. 2018). Mutations in its gene gives rise to fetal goitrous hypothyroidism (Stoupa et al. 2020). Iodide transport across thyrocytes constitutes a critical step for thyroid hormone biosynthesis, mediated mainly by the basolateral NIS and the apical anion exchanger pendrin (PDS; SLC26A4; TC# 2.A.53.2.17) (Eleftheriadou et al. 2020). Autoimmunity against NIS for thyroid disease has been documented (Eleftheriadou et al. 2020). The iodide transport defect-causing Y348D mutation in the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) renders the protein intrinsically inactive and impairs its targeting to the plasma membrane (Reyna-Neyra et al. 2021). Mutations in NIS can give rise to congenital hypothyroidism (Zhang et al. 2021). Iodide transport defect is a cause of dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the SLC5A5 gene, causing deficient iodide accumulation in thyroid follicular cells (Martín and Nicola 2021). NIS mediates active iodide accumulation in the thyroid follicular cell. Autosomal recessive iodide transport defect (ITD)-causing loss-of-function NIS variants lead to dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism (DCH) due to deficient iodide accumulation for thyroid hormonogenesis (Bernal Barquero et al. 2022). An intramolecular interaction between R130 and D369 is required for NIS maturation and plasma membrane expression (Bernal Barquero et al. 2022). An Inverse agonist of estrogen-related receptor gamma, GSK5182, enhances Na+/I- symporter function in radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer cells (Singh et al. 2023). The identification of sodium/iodide symporter metastable intermediates provides insights into conformational transition between principal thermodynamic states (Chakrabarti et al. 2023).  Advanced differentiated thyroid cancer that is resistant to radioactive 
iodine therapy may become responsive with a unique treatment combination
 of chloroquine and vorinostat. This treatment was demonstrated in 
cellular and animal models of thyroid cancer to inhibit endocytosis of 
the plasma membrane bound iodine transporter, NIS, and restore iodine 
uptake (Lechner and Brent 2024).  CMTM 6 promotes the development of thyroid cancer by inhibiting NIS activity by activating the MAPK signaling pathway (Chen et al. 2024)."	Animals

Pyroglutamate (5-oxoproline) is also transported in a Na+- coupled mechanism (Miyauchi et al., 2010). SMCT1 and SMCT2 may transport monocarboxylate drugs (e.g. nicotinate and its derivatives) across the intestinal brush boarder membrane (Gopal et al., 2007; Frank et al. 2008). Wilson et al., 2009 have proposed mechanistic details. SMCT1 can transport urate in a testosterone regulated process (Hosoyamada et al., 2010).  It's phsiological functions have been reviewed (Halestrap 2013).

Holling et al. 2022 expanded the phenotypic spectrum associated with biallelic SLC5A6 variants affecting function by reporting five individuals from three families with motor neuropathies. Missense variants p.(Tyr162Cys) and p.(Ser429Gly) did not affect plasma membrane localization of the ectopically expressed multivitamin transporter, suggesting reduced function, such as lower catalytic activity (Holling et al. 2022).

binding to interleukin-1, it associates with the coreceptor IL1RAP to form 
the high affinity interleukin-1 receptor complex which mediates 
interleukin-1-dependent activation of NF-kappa-B, MAPK and other 
pathways. Signaling involves the recruitment of adapter molecules such 
as TOLLIP, MYD88, and IRAK1 or IRAK2 via the respective TIR domains of 
the receptor/coreceptor subunits. It binds ligands with comparable affinity,
 and binding of antagonist IL1RN prevents association with IL1RAP to

conserved structures that connect differentiating germ cells and are 
required for spermatogenesis, oogenesis and male fertility. They act by promoting the 
conversion of midbodies into intercellular bridges via its interaction 
with CEP55. Interaction with CEP55 inhibits the interaction between 
CEP55 and PDCD6IP/ALIX and TSG101, blocking cell abscission and leading 
to transformation of midbodies into intercellular bridges. In spite of its PK domain, it has no protein kinase activity in vitro (Lei and Spradling 2016)."	Tex14 of Homo sapiens

The expression of  Tmem25 is strongly influenced by glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4, and it is primarily localized to late endosomes in neurons (Zhang et al. 2019). The effects of TMEM25 on neuronal excitability are likely mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. TMEM25 affects the expression of the NR2B subunit and interacts with NR2B; both colocalize to late endosome compartments. TMEM25 induces acidification changes in lysosome compartments and accelerates the degradation of NR2B, and TMEM25 expression is decreased in brain tissues from patients with epilepsy and epileptic mice. TMEM25 overexpression attenuated the behavioral phenotypes of epileptic seizures, whereas TMEM25 downregulation exerted the opposite effect (Zhang et al. 2019). TMEM25 inhibits monomeric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated STAT3 activation in the basal state to suppress triple-negative breast cancer progression (Bi et al. 2023).  In neurons, TMEM25 modulates the degradation of the NMDA receptor GRIN2B subunit. Thus, TMEM25 regulates neuronal excitability (An et al. 2023).  TMEM25 is a Par3-binding protein that attenuates claudin assembly during tight junction development (Kamakura et al. 2024).

Microbial metabolism often uses H+/Na+-translocating ferredoxin:NAD+ reductase (Rnf), either to exergonically oxidize reduced ferredoxin by NAD+ for generating a transmembrane electrochemical potential, or reversely to exploit the latter for producing reduced ferredoxin. The electron transfer route between ferredoxin and NAD via eight [4Fe-4S] clusters, one Fe ion and four flavins crossing the cell membrane twice related to the pathway of NADH:ubiquinone reductase. Redox-coupled Na+ translocation is provided by orchestrating Na+ uptake/release, electrostatic effects of the assumed membrane-integrated FMN semiquinone anion and accompanied polypeptide rearrangements mediated by different redox steps (Vitt et al. 2022).

2.A.81.1.1	"The L-aspartate:L-alanine exchanger, AspT (Abe et al. 1996; Abe et al. 2002).  A mutant, R76K, has higher
activity than the AspT-WT (R76), whereas R76D and R76E have lower activity than AspT-WT. Thus, R76 is involved in AspT substrate transport (Suzuki et al. 2016).  AspT catalyzes self-exchange of aspartate and electrogenic heterologous 
exchange of aspartate with alanine. Thus, the asp operon confers a 
proton motive metabolic cycle consisting of the electrogenic 
aspartate-alanine antiporter and  aspartate decarboxylase, which 
keeps intracellular levels of alanine, the countersubstrate for 
aspartate, high (Abe et al. 2002). AspT has been reported to have a unique topology; 8 TMS, a large cytoplasmic loop (183 amino 
acids) between TMS5 and TMS6, and N- and C-termini that both face the 
periplasm. This may be a unique 2D-structure of AspT, a representative of the novel AAE family (Nanatani et al. 2005). However, bioinformatic analyses suggest that this prediction may be in error, and the true topology is 12 TMSs with an internal repeat of 6 TMSs (M. Saier, unpublished observations; see 2.A.81.2.1). The Km values = 0.35 mm for L-aspartate, 0.098 mm for 
D-aspartate, 26 mm for L-alanine, and 3.3 mm for 
D-alanine). Competitive inhibition by various amino acids of L-aspartate
 or L-alanine in self-exchange reactions revealed that L-cysteine 
selectively inhibited L-aspartate self-exchange but only weakly 
inhibited L-alanine self-exchange while L-serine selectively 
inhibited L-alanine self-exchange but barely inhibited L-aspartate 
self-exchange. The aspartate analogs L-cysteine sulfinic acid, L-cysteic
 acid, and D-cysteic acid competitively and strongly inhibited 
L-aspartate self-exchange compared with L-alanine self-exchange. Taken 
together, these kinetic data suggest that the putative binding sites of 
L-aspartate and L-alanine are independently located in the substrate 
translocation pathway of AspT (Sasahara et al. 2011). L-Ala binding yields a conformation different from the apo or L-Asp binding conformations (Suzuki et al. 2022)."	Bacteria and archaea

The thrid TMS in YidC contacts the substrate protein (Yu et al., 2008).  YidC occupies the lateral gate of the SecYEG translocase and is sequentially displaced by the nascent membrane protein (Sachelaru et al. 2013).  Residues involved in interaction with the Sec translocon have been identified (Li et al. 2014). YidC acts as a flexible chaperone,
facilitating LacY folding (Zhu et al. 2013; Hennon and Dalbey 2014).  The structure of the dimeric insertion pore associated with the translating ribosome has been solved (Kohler et al. 2009).  A single copy of YidC interacts with the ribosome at the ribosomal tunnel; a site for membrane protein insertion at the YidC protein-lipid interface has been identified (Wickles et al. 2014).  The crystal structure of full-length E. coli YidC revealed
that a hydrophilic groove, formed by five transmembrane helices, is a conserved structural feature as compared to the previous YidC structure from Bacillus halodurans, which lacks a
periplasmic domain. Structural mapping of the substrate- or Sec protein-contact sites suggested the
importance of the groove for the YidC functions as a chaperone and an insertase (Kumazaki et al. 2014). Pf3 is inserted as a helical hairpin, i.e., the prospective TMS moves 
along the YidC greasy slide comprised of TMS3 and TMS5, whereas the 
N-terminal tail transiently folds back into the hydrophilic groove of 
YidC located in the inner leaflet of the membrane until it is

9.B.104.1.1	GlpG rhomboid serine protease (276aas ; 6 TMSs; DUF3582; Structure known) (Vinothkumar, 2011; Wang et al. 2006). The requirements for cleavage have been defined (Akiyama and Maegawa 2007). The catalytic Ser201, is located at the N terminus of TMS 4, approximately 10 Å below the membrane surface. Access to water molecules is provided by a central cavity that opens to the extracellular region and converges on Ser201. One of the two GlpG molecules in the asymmetric unit has an open conformation at the active site, with TMS 5 bent away from the rest of the molecule. Substrate entry to the active site is probably gated by the movement of TMS 5 (Wu et al. 2006). Rhomboid proteases GlpG and Rhom7 are involved in membrane protein quality control by specifically targeting components of respiratory complexes. The metastable transmembrane domains of rhomboid substrates are protected when they are incorporated into a functional complex (Liu et al. 2020).	Bacteria

9.B.104.1.7	Rhomboid protease (peptidase) of 192 aas and 6 TMSs, GlpG. The structure has been solved at 2.2 Å resolution, revealing the relative disposition of the nucleophilic serine to the general base/acid function of the conserved histidine (Lemieux et al. 2007). The active site is inside the membrane, but near the surface, to release the hydrophilic ectodomain of its single TMS substrate. These enzymes may thin the membrane, allowing access of water to the active site. There is a cavity adjacent to the cleavage site containing ordered water molecules, involved in access to the substrate before cleavage (Sanders and Hutchison 2018). Factors that control the force needed to unfold a membrane protein in silico depend on the mode of denaturation (Faruk et al. 2023).	GlpG of Haemophilus influenzae

identified in a homologue, one in the membrane and one on the external

Mendez et al. 2022 described cryo-EM structures of CcsBA, which, as noted above, is a bifunctional heme transporter and cytochrome c (cyt c) synthase. Models built from the cryo-EM densities show that CcsBA is trapped with heme in two conformations, closed and open states. The closed state has heme located solely at a transmembrane (TM) site, with a large periplasmic domain oriented such that access of heme to the cytochrome acceptor is prevented. The open conformation contains two heme moieties, one in the TM-heme site and another in an external site (P-heme site). The presence of heme in the periplasmic site at the base of a chamber induces a large conformational shift that exposes the heme for reaction with apocytochrome c (apocyt c). Consistent with these structures, in vivo and in vitro cyt c synthase studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of the periplasmic heme to cytochrome (Mendez et al. 2022)."	Bacteria

EccB, a periplasmic homoheximer with the ATP-binding active site shared by two adjacent subunits, may
act as the energy provider in the transport of T7SS virulence factors and may be involved in the
formation of a channel across the mycomembrane (Zhang et al. 2015). ESX-1 functions in resistance to and evasion of host responses.  It induces phagosomal rupture which releases bacteria into the cytosol of the host phagocytes (Gröschel et al. 2016). ESX-1 secrete EsxA and EsxB, which form a heterodimer, seem to have differing functions as EsxA can disrupt lipid bilayers (RBC and artificial membranes.  Thus EsxA may form pores as a prelude to membrane disruption (Gröschel et al. 2016)."

Thus, ESX-5 exports protein substrate (Houben et al. 2012).  PE25/PPE41form a heterodimer that is targeted to the T7SS, ESX5, by a C-terminal signal in PE25 which is necessary but not sufficient for targeting to ESX5 (Daleke et al. 2012).  An esx-5 mutant is strongly impaired in the uptake and utilization of 
hydrophobic carbon sources. Possibly the ESX-5 system is responsible for the transport of cell envelope
 proteins that are required for nutrient uptake (Ates et al. 2015).  Mycobacterium tuberculosis releases membrane vesicles (MV) that modulate host immune responses and aid in iron acquisition, and the ESX-5 system seems to play a role, together with the SenX3-RegX3 complex which regulates the process (White et al. 2018). The 3-D structure of ESX-5 has been determined (Bunduc et al. 2021) (see ESX5 family description, paragraph 11 for details). The structure of the mycobacterial ESX-5 type VII secretion system pore complex has been determined (Beckham et al. 2021). The high-resolution structure of the 2.1-megadalton ESX-5 core complex captured a dynamic, secretion-competent conformation of the pore within a well-defined transmembrane section, sandwiched between two flexible protein layers at the cytosolic entrance and the periplasmic exit. Beckham et al. 2021 proposed that this flexibility endows the ESX-5 machinery with large conformational plasticity required to accommodate targeted protein secretion.

LptDE (1:1 stoichiometry) comprise a two-protein β-barrel-lipoprotein complex in the outer membrane that assembles and exports LPS (Chng et al., 2010).  After LPS (or a precursor) is transported across the inner membrane by MsbA (3.A.1.106.1), this seven component system translocates LPS from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer surface of the outer membrane using ATP hydrolysis to sequentially energize transfer from one binding site to another in several steps (Freinkman et al. 2012; Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014).  LPS interacts with LptC and LptA sequentially before being passed to the LptD outer membrane porin, anchored by the LptE lipoprotein on the inner surface of the outer membrane.  LptF and LptG are the transmembrane consituents of the ABC pump, and LptB is the ATPase of an ABC-like system that energizes the transport using several ATP molecules (Okuda et al. 2012;  Sherman et al. 2014).  LptC interconnects the LptBFG ABC system with the periplasmic LptA protein via its large periplasmic domain (Villa et al. 2013).  LptDE form a complex in the outer membrane which inserts LPS into this membrane.  The 3-D strcture of the complex shows that the LptE lipoprotein inserts into the 26 stranded barrel of LptD as a plug.  The first two strands of LptD contain prolines and are therefore distorted, possibly creating a portal for lateral diffusion of LPS into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (Qiao et al. 2014).  The 3-d structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LptA, LptH, has been solved at 2:75 Å resolution revealing a β-jellyroll fold similar to that in LptD (Bollati et al. 2015). Direct interaction of LptB and LptC has been demonstrated (Martorana et al. 2016). A specific binding site in the LptB ATPase for the coupling helices of the transmembrane LptFG complex 
is responsible for coupling ATP hydrolysis by LptB with LptFG 
function to achieve LPS extraction (Simpson et al. 2016). After biosynthesis, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are transiently anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). The ABC transporter LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa. It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). Transport involves a stable association between the inner (LptBFG) and outer  (LptDE)
membrane components, supporting a mechanism in which 
lipopolysaccharide molecules are pushed one after the other across a protein bridge (LptCA) that connects the inner 
and outer membranes (Sherman et al. 2018).  The ABC transporter, LptB2FG, which tightly associates with LptC, extracts lipopolysaccharide out of the inner membrane.Li et al. 2019 characterized the structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures resolve the bound lipopolysaccharide, reveal transporter-lipopolysaccharide interactions with side-chain details and uncover how the capture and extrusion of lipopolysaccharide are coupled to conformational rearrangements of LptB2FGC. LptC inserts its TMS between the two transmembrane domains of LptB2FG, which represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for ABC transporters. These results suggest a role for LptC in achieving efficient lipopolysaccharide transport, by coordinating the action of LptB2FG in the inner membrane and Lpt protein interactions in the periplasm (Li et al. 2019). cryo-EM structures of LptB2FG alone and complexed with LptC are known, revealing conformational changes between these states. Two functional transmembrane arginine-containing loops interact with bound AMP-PNP which induces an inward rotation and shift of the transmembrane helices of LptFG and LptC to tighten the cavity, with the closure of two lateral gates, to eventually expel LPS into the bridge (Tang et al. 2019). The ABC transporter, LptB2FGC extracts LPS from the inner membrane and places it onto a periplasmic protein bridge. Lundstedt et al. 2020 showed that residue E86 of LptB is essential for coupling the function of this ATPase to that of its membrane partners, LptFG, at the step where ATP binding drives the closure of the LptB dimer and the collapse of the LPS-binding cavity in LptFG that moves LPS to the Lpt periplasmic bridge consisting of LptC, A and D (from inside to out) and then to the outer membrane insertase, LptE. Defects caused by changing residue E86 are suppressed by mutations altering either the LPS structure or TMSs in LptG. These suppressors fix defects in the coupling helix of LptF, but not of LptG. These observations support a transport mechanism in which the ATP-driven movements of LptB and those of the substrate-binding cavity in LptFG are bi-directionally coordinated through the rigid-body coupling, with LptF's coupling helix being important in coordinating cavity collapse with LptB dimerization (Lundstedt et al. 2020). The TMS of LptC participates in LPS extraction by the LptB2 FGC transporter (Wilson and Ruiz 2022). A  small molecule, IMB-0042, inhibits the interaction of LPS transporter proteins, LptA and LptC. This give rise to filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm (Dai et al. 2022). Macrocyclic peptide (MCP) antibiotics have potent antibacterial activity and represent a new class of antibiotics (Zampaloni et al. 2024), and LptB2FGC is target. Pahil et al. 2024 showed that novel antibiotics trap a substrate-bound conformation of the 
LPS transporter that stalls this machine. The inhibitors accomplish this
 by recognizing a composite binding site made up of both the Lpt 
transporter and its LPS substrate. The identity of an unusual mechanism of lipid transport inhibition reveals a druggable 
conformation of the Lpt transporter and provides the foundation for 
extending this class of antibiotics to other Gram-negative pathogens (Pahil et al. 2024).  Residues within the LptC transmembrane helix are critical for E. coli LptB(2) FG ATPase (Cina et al. 2024).

The binding and transport of L- and D-aspartate have been studied, revealing that both the L- and D-aspartate bound GltTk structures with only minor rearrangements in the structure of the binding site (Arkhipova et al. 2019). A conserved methionine residue plays a role in the ion symport process, apparently by influencing the specific kinetics in the binding reaction, which, while influential for the turnover rate, does not fundamentally explain the ion-coupling mechanism (Zhou et al. 2021). The 3-d structure is available (PDB # 6XWO).  It has a covalent trimeric transporter structure with an interconnecting rigid scafford domain (trimerization domain) on the inside. This seems to be a unique structure for a transporter (Colucci et al. 2023). The structure of the P208R mutant is also known (Colucci et al. 2023).	Glt of Thermococcus (Pyrococcus) kodakarensis

Cotransports aspartate with 2 Na+  (Ryan et al., 2009) or 3 Na+  (Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2010) or 1Na+ plus 1 H+ plus 1 K+ (Machtens et al. 2015). Reyes et al. (2009) have solved the structure of the inward facing state by cysteine crosslinking. The loop between TMSs 3 and 4 plays an essential role in transport (Compton et al., 2010). Gltph shows opposite movement of the external gate upon binding cotransported sodium compared with substrate (Focke et al., 2011).  The transport pathway and the conformational changes involved have been suggested based on modeling studies (Stolzenberg et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2018).  Individual transport domains may alternate between periods of quiescence and
periods of rapid transitions.  The switch to the dynamic mode may be due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold which precedes domain
movements across the bilayer (Akyuz et al. 2013). This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain
is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining
in the transport cycle.  Interactions between the transporter and specific lipids in artificial membranes have revealed effects on activity, and mechanisms have been proposed (McIlwain et al. 2015).  The system can also function as an anion channel (Machtens et al. 2015).

EAAT1 interacts directly with the Na+, K+-ATPase (TC #3.A.3.1) (Rose et al., 2009). CEAT1 couples glutamate uptake to the symport of 3 Na+ and 1 H+ followed by the antiport of 1 K+. It can function as an uncoupled anion, water and/or urea channel (Vandenberg et al., 2011). Large collective motions regulate the functional properties of EAAT1 trimers (Jiang et al., 2011).  The reentrant helical
hairpin loop, HP1, functions during the transport cycle as the proposed internal gate. 
HP1 is packed against transmembrane domain, TMS 2 and TMS5 in its closed state, and two residues
located in TM2 and HP2 of EAAT1 are in close proximity (Zhang et al. 2014).  In EAAT1, R388 is a critical element for the structural

Cotransports glutamic acid with three Na+ followed by countertransport of K+ (Teichman et al., 2009). The C-terminal 74aa domain regulates transport activity (Leinenweber et al., 2011). Hippocampal glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) levels parallel memory training (Heo et al., 2011). GLT-1 is regulated by MAGI-1 (Zou et al., 2011).  Venom from the spider Parawixia
bistriata and a purified compound (Parawixin1) stimulate EAAT2 activity and protect retinal tissue
from ischemic damage (Mortensen et al. 2015).  Determinants of this stimulation are at the interface of the trimerization and substrate transport domains ((Mortensen et al. 2015). TMS4 of GLT-1 undergoes a complex conformational shift during substrate translocation (Rong et al. 2016). Both reentrant loops determine the cation specificity (Silverstein et al. 2018).  A  tight spatial and functional relationship between the DAT/GLT-1

glutamate-mediated signals by the clearance of glutamate after synaptic release. It
also has an anion channel activity that prevents additional glutamate release. This system may be important for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Parkin et al. 2018). Substrate-induced structural rearrangements occur between the TMS4b-4c loop and TMS7 during the transport cycle (Zhang et al. 2019). GLAST serves as a cell surface biomarker for astrocytes (Kumar et al. 2021). It interacts with NHERF1 and NHERF2 (see TC# 8.A.24.1.1) which modify its cell surface expression (Sato et al. 2013). The inhibitor, UCPH-101 slows substrate translocation rather than substrate or Na+ binding, confirming a non-competitive inhibitory mechanism. However, it only 
partially inhibits wild-type ASCT2 with relatively low affinity (Dong et al. 2023).  Perivascular fibroblasts expressing SLC1A3 are essential for
 penile erection in mice because they reduce norepinephrine 
availability, thereby promoting dilation of the corpora cavernosa. The 
number of SLC1A3+ perivascular fibroblasts decreased in aged mice, which reduced penile blood flow (Guimaraes et al. 2024)."	Animals
2.A.23.2.7	Excitatory amino acid transporter 2, EAAT2 (Glutamate/aspartate transporter II) (Sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 2) (Solute carrier family 1 member 2).  This system may be important for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Parkin et al. 2018). Amino acids in the TMS2 of EAAT2 are essential for membrane-bound localization, substrate binding, transporter function and anion currents (Mai et al. 2021). The distance between the TMS3-TMS4 loop and TMS7 changes when substrates are transported (Qu et al. 2021).  SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 encode the glial glutamate transporters EAAT2 and EAAT1, which are not only the predominant glutamate uptake carriers in the brain, but also function as anion channels. Two homologous mutations, which substitute prolines in the center of the fifth TMS by arginine (P289R EAAT2, P290R EAAT1) cause  epileptic encephalopathy (SLC1A2) or with episodic ataxia type 6 (SLC1A3). Both mutations impair glutamate uptake and increase anion conduction (Suslova et al. 2023). Additionally, the P312R mutation generates an anion conducting state that is accessible in the outward facing apo state that is the main determinant of the increased anion conduction of EAAT transporters carrying this mutation.

1.A.1.1.1	"Two TMS K+ and water channel (conducts K+ (KD = 8 mM); blocked by Na+ (190 mM) (Renart et al., 2006) and tetrabutylammonium (Iwamoto et al., 2006)). Ion permeation occurs by ion-ion contacts in single file fashion through the selectivity filter (Köpfer et al. 2014). A narrow pore lined with four arrays of carbonyl groups is responsible for
ion selectivity, whereas a conformational change of the four inner transmembrane helices (TMS2) is
involved in gating (Baker et al. 2007). Two gates have been identified; one is located at the inner bundle crossing and is activated by H+ while the second gate is in the selectivity filter (Rauh et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain mediates pH modulation (Hirano et al., 2011; Pau et al., 2007). KcsA exhibits a global twisting motion upon gating (Shimizu et al., 2008).  Activity is influenced by the phase of the lipid bilayer (Seeger et al. 2010), and occupancy of nonannular lipid binding sites increases the stability of the tetrameric complex (Triano et al. 2010).  The open conformation of KcsA can disturb the bilayer integrity and catalyze the flipping of
phospholipids (Nakao et al. 2014).  This protein is identical to the KcsA orthologue (P0A333) in Streptomyces coelicolor.  The stability of the pre domain in KcsA is stabilized by GCN4 (Yuchi et al. 2008).  The
potential role of pore hydration in channel gating has been evaluated (Blasic et al. 2015).  Having multiple K+ ions bound simultaneously
is required for selective K+ conduction, and a reduction in the number of bound K+ ions
destroys the multi-ion selectivity mechanism utilized by K+ channels (Medovoy et al. 2016).  The channel accomodates K+ and H2O molecules alternately in a K+-H2O-K+-H2O  series through the channel (Kratochvil et al. 2016). Insertion of KcsA is spontaneous and directional as the
cytosolic part of the protein does not translocate across the membrane barrier. Charged residues, not hydrophobic residues, are crucial for insertion of the unfolded protein
into the membrane via electrostatic interactions between
membrane and protein.  A two-step
mechanism was proposed. An initial electrostatic attraction between membrane and protein
represents the first step prior to insertion of hydrophobic residues into the hydrocarbon core of
the membrane (Altrichter et al. 2016). Bend, splay, and twist distinguish KcsA gate opening, filter opening, and filter-gate coupling, respectively (Mitchell and Leibler 2017). Details of the water permeability have been presented. Water flow through KcsA is halved by 200 mM K+ in the aqueous 
solution, which indicates an effective K+ dissociation constant in 
that range for a singly occupied channel. (Hoomann et al. 2013). A parameterized MARTINI program can be used to predict the hinging motions of the protein (Li et al. 2019). Activation of KcsA is initiated by proton binding to the pH gate upon an intracellular drop in pH which prompts a conformational switch, leading to a loss of affinity for potassium ions at the selectivity filter and therefore to channel inactivation (Rivera-Torres et al. 2016). An alteration in the conformational equilibrium of the intracellular K+-gate is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the dysfunctions of K+ channels caused by disease-related mutations (Iwahashi et al. 2020). Folding and misfolding of KcsA monomers during assembly and tetramerization has been examined (Song et al. 2021). The flexible C-terminus stabilizes KcsA tetramers at a neutral pH with decreased stabilization at acidic pH (Howarth and McDermott 2022). Under equilibrium conditions, in the absence of a transmembrane voltage, both water and K+ occupy the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel in the closed conductive state (Ryan et al. 2023)."

1.A.1.10.1	"Voltage-sensitive Na+ channel, NaV1.7 (Cox et al., 2006). The human orthologue, SCN3A or Nav1.3, when mutated causes cryptogenic pediatric partial epilepsy (Holland et al., 2008; Zaman et al. 2020). Batrachotoxin (BTX) is a steroidal alkaloid
neurotoxin that activates NaV channels through interacting with transmembrane domain-I-segment 6
(IS6) of these channels. Ginsenoside inhibits BTX binding (Lee et al. 2008). VGSCs are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of a single pore-forming alpha subunit joined by two beta subunits, a noncovalently linked beta1 or beta3 and a covalently linked beta2 or beta4 subunit (Hull and Isom 2017).  The binding mode and functional components of the analgesic-antitumour peptide from Buthus martensii Karsch to human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 have been characterized (Zhao et al. 2019). Dvorak et al. 2021 developed allosteric modulators of ion channels by targeting their PPI interfaces, particularly in the C-terminal domain of the Nav, with auxiliary proteins. Fenestrations are key functional regions of Nav that modulate drug binding, lipid binding, and influence gating behaviors (Gamal El-Din and Lenaeus 2022). Compartment-specific localizations and trafficking mechanisms for VGSCs are regulated separately to modulate membrane excitability in the brain (Liu et al. 2022). Naview is a library for drawing and annotating voltage-gated sodium channel membrane diagrams (Afonso et al. 2022). Deltamethrin (DLT) is a type-II pyrethroid ester insecticide used in agricultural and domestic applications as well as in public health. Exposure to DLT produced a differential and dose-dependent stimulation of peak Na+ currents, Conversely, tefluthrin (Tef), a type-I pyrethroid insecticide, accentuates I(Na) with a slowing in inactivation time course of the current (Lin et al. 2022). MicroRNA-335-5p suppresses voltage-gated sodium channel expression and may be a target for seizure control (Heiland et al. 2023).  Voltage-gated sodium channels are enhancing factors in the metastasis of metastatic prostate cancer cells (Yildirim-Kahriman 2023). Decreasing microtubule detyrosination 
modulates Nav1.5 subcellular distribution and restores sodium current in Mdx cardiomyocytes (Nasilli et al. 2024)."	Animals

bind to and trap sodium channels in the slow-inactivated non-conducting state, a mode of action
similar to that of local anesthetics (Jiang et al. 2015).  Asp802 is involved in gating and action, but not binding, of pyrethroid insecticides (Du et al. 2010)."	Animals (Insects)

1.A.1.10.12	Type 2 Na+ channel, SCN2A or NaV1.2, of 2,005 aas and 24 TMSs.  Mutations give rise to epileptic encephalophathy, Ohtahara syndrome (Nakamura et al. 2013). They may also give rise to autism (ASD) (Tavassoli et al. 2014). This protein is orthologous to the rat Na+ channel, TC# 1.A.1.10.1 and very similar to the type 1 Na+ channel (1.A.1.10.7). NaV1.2 has a single pore-forming alpha-subunit and two transmembrane beta-subunits. Expressed primarily in the brain, NaV1.2 is critical for initiation and propagation of action potentials. Milliseconds after the pore opens, sodium influx is terminated by inactivation processes mediated by regulatory proteins including calmodulin (CaM). Both calcium-free (apo) CaM and calcium-saturated CaM bind tightly to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit. Thermodynamic studies and solution structure (2KXW) of a C-domain fragment of apo 13C,15N- CaM (CaMC) bound to an unlabeled peptide with the sequence of the rat NaV1.2 IQ motif showed that apo CaMC (a) was necessary and sufficient for binding, and (b) bound more favorably than calcium-saturated CaMC. CaMN  apparently does not influence apo CaM binding to NaV1.2IQp (Mahling et al. 2017). The phenotypic spectrum of SCN2A-related epilepsy is broad, ranging from benign epilepsy in neonate and infancy to severe epileptic encephalopathy. Oxcarbazepine and valproate are the most effective drugs in epilepsy patients with SCN2A variants. Sodium channel blockers often worsen seizures in patients with seizure onset beyond 1 year of age. Abnormal brain MRI findings and de novo variations are often related to poor prognosis. Most SCN2A variants located in transmembrane regions were related to patients with developmental delay (Zeng et al. 2022). The beta4-subunit and PRRT2 form a push-pull system that finely tunes the membrane expression and function of NaV channels and the intrinsic neuronal excitability (Valente et al. 2022). Icariin can be used to treat epilepsy by inhibiting neuroinflammation via promoting microglial polarization to the M2 phenotype (Wang et al. 2023).	Animals

of flagella and is transported toward the flagellar tip via
intraflagellar transport (IFT) although CAV2 accumulates near the flagellar base when IFT is
blocked. Thus, Ca2+ influx into Chlamydomonas flagella is
mediated by the VDCC, CAV2, whose distribution is biased to the distal region of the flagellum, and this is required for flagellar waveform conversion (Fujiu et al. 2009)."	Plants (Algae)

The immunoglobulin domain of beta1 docks onto the extracellular L5I and L6IV loops of EeNav1.4 via extensive polar interactions, and the single transmembrane helix interacts with the third voltage-sensing domain (VSDIII). The VSDs exhibit """"up"""" conformations, while the intracellular gate of the pore domain is kept open by a digitonin-like molecule. Structural comparison with closed NavPaS shows that the outward transfer of gating charges is coupled to the iris-like pore domain dilation through intricate force transmissions involving multiple channel segments. The IFM fast inactivation motif on the III-IV linker is plugged into the corner enclosed by the outer S4-S5 and inner S6 segments in repeats III and IV, suggesting a potential allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation (Yan et al. 2017).

It mediates the voltage-dependent sodium ion permeability of excitable 
membranes. Assuming opened or closed conformations in response to the

1.A.1.10.3	"Ca2+-regulated heart Na+ channel, Nav1.5, SCN5A or INa channel of 2016 aas. The COOH terminus functions in the control of channel inactivation and in pathologies caused by inherited mutations that disrupt it (Glaaser et al., 2006); regulated by ProTx-II Toxin (Smith et al. 2007), telethonin, the titin cap protein (167aas; secreted protein; O15273) (Mazzone et al., 2008), and the Mog1 protein, a central component of the channel complex (Wu et al., 2008). Nav1.5, the principal Na+ channel in the heart, possesses an ankyrin binding site, and direct interaction with ankyrin-G is required for the expression of Nav1.5 at the cardiomyocyte cell surface (Bennett and Healy, 2008; Lowe et al., 2008). Mutations cause type 3 long QT syndrome and type 1 Brugada syndrome, two distinct heritable arrhythmia syndromes (Mazzone et al., 2008; Kapplinger et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2015). SCN5A mutations causing arrhythmic dilated cardiomyopathy,  commonly localized to the voltage-sensing mechanism, and giving rise to gating pore currents (currents that go through the voltage sensor) have been identified (McNair et al., 2011; Moreau et al., 2014).  Patients with Brugada syndrome
are prone to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmias that may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest or sudden
cardiac death (Sheikh and Ranjan 2014) and (Kapplinger et al. 2015). Mutations causing disease have been identified (Qureshi et al. 2015). These give rise to arrhythias and cardiomyopathies (Moreau et al. 2015).  Mutations that cause relative resistance to slow inactivation have been identified (Chancey et al. 2007).  Green tea catechins are potential anti-arrhythmics because of the
significant effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (E3G) on  cardiac sodium
channelopathies that display a hyperexcitability phenotype (Boukhabza et al. 2016). A mutatioin, R367G, causes the familial cardiac conductioin disease (Yu et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain of calmodulin (CaM) binds to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit of all NaV isoforms, and contributes to calcium-dependent pore-gating in some (Isbell et al. 2018). Ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) is often initiated by premature ventricular contractions, and the presence of SCN5A mutations increases the risk upon exposure to sodium channel blockers in patients with or without baseline type-1 ECG (Amin et al. 2018). A mutation (R367G) is associated with familial cardiac conduction disease (Yu et al. 2017).  Among ranolazine, flecainide, and mexiletine, only mexiletine restored inactivation kinetics of the currents of the mutant protein, A1656D (Kim et al. 2019).  Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is protective against cardiovascular disorders due in part to its action on multiple molecular pathways and transmembrane proteins, including the cardiac Nav1.5 channels (Amarouch et al. 2020). An SCN1B variant affects both cardiac-type (NaV1.5) and brain-type 
(NaV1.1) sodium currents and contributes to complex concomitant brain 
and cardiac disorders (Martinez-Moreno et al. 2020). Mice null for Scn1b, which encodes NaV beta1 and beta1b subunits, have defects in neuronal development and excitability, spontaneous generalized seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and early mortality (Martinez-Moreno et al., 2020; Martinez-Moreno et al. 2020). The structural basis of cytoplasmic NaV1.5 and NaV1.4 regulation has been reviewed (Nathan et al. 2021). Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 channel dysregulation in human AC16 cardiomyocytes (Li et al. 2021). The interaction of Nav1.5 with MOG1 (RANGRF), a Ran guanine nucleotide release factor and chaparone, provides a possible molecular mechanism for Brugada syndrome (Xiong et al. 2021). Arrhythmic phenotypes are a defining feature of dilated cardiomyopathy-associated SCN5A variants (Peters et al. 2021). A SCN5A genetic variant, Y739D, is associated with Brugada syndrome (Zaytseva et al. 2022). Melatonin treatment causes an increase of conduction via enhancement of sodium channel protein expression and increases of sodium current in the ventricular myocytes (Durkina et al. 2022). Quantification of Nav1.5 expression has been published (Adams et al. 2022). Cardiac sodium channel complexes play a role in arrhythmia, and the structural and functional roles of the beta1 and beta3 subunits have been determined (Salvage et al. 2022). Brugada Syndrome (BrS) treatment is 
electrocardiography with ST-segment elevation in the direct precordial 
derivations. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly 
variable. Patients can remain completely asymptomatic, but they can 
also develop episodes of syncope, atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus node 
dysfunction (SNF), conduction disorders, asystole, and ventricular 
fibrillation (VF). This disease is caused by mutations in the genes 
responsible for the potential action of cardiac cells. The most commonly
 involved gene is SCN5A, which controls the structure and function of 
the heart's sodium channel (Brugada 2023)."	Animals
1.A.1.10.4	"The skeletal muscle Na+ channel, NaV1.4 of 1836 aas and 24 TMSs. Mutations in charged residues in the S4 segment cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP)) due to sustained sarcolemmal depolarization (Struyk and Cannon 2007; Sokolov et al., 2007; Groome et al. 2014). Also causes myotonia; regulated by calmodulin which binds to the C-terminus of Nav1.4 (Biswas et al., 2008). NaV1.4 gating pores are permeable to guanidine as well as Na+ and H+ (Sokolov et al., 2010). The R669H mutation allows transmembrane
permeation of protons, but not larger cations, similar to the conductance displayed by histidine
substitution at Shaker K+ channel S4 sites (Struyk and Cannon 2007).  The mechanism of inactivation involves transient
interactions between intracellular domains resulting in direct pore occlusion by the IFM motif and
concomitant extracellular interactions with the beta1 subunit (Sánchez-Solano et al. 2016). Potassium-sensitive hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis are inherited skeletal muscle diseases in humans, characterized by episodes of flaccid muscle weakness. They are caused by single mutations in positively charged residues ('gating charges') in the S4 transmembrane segment of the voltage sensor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 or the calcium channel Cav1.1. Mutations of the outermost gating charges (R1 and R2) cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis by creating a pathogenic gating pore in the voltage sensor through which cations leak in the resting state. Mutations of the third gating charge (R3) cause normokalaemic periodic paralysis owing to cation leak in both activated and inactivated states (Jiang et al. 2018). The neurotoxic cone snail peptide μ-GIIIA specifically blocks skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium (NaV1.4) channels (Leipold et al. 2017). the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Nav1.4-β1
 complex at 3.2-Å resolution. Accurate model building was made for the 
pore domain, the voltage-sensing domains, and the β1 subunit (Pan et al. 2018) provided 
insight into the molecular basis for Na+ permeation and 
kinetic asymmetry of the four repeats. Structural analysis of reported 
functional residues and disease mutations corroborates an allosteric 
blocking mechanism for fast inactivation of Nav channels. the S4-S5L of the DI, DII and DIII domains allosterically modulate the activation gate and stabilize its open state (Malak et al. 2020). The structural basis of cytoplasmic NaV1.5 and NaV1.4 regulation has been reviewed (Nathan et al. 2021). Mutations in SCN4A give rise to a variety of pathological conditions (Sun et al. 2021). Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in either calcium or sodium transmembrane voltage-gated ion channels in the ER of skeletal muscle (Calise et al. 2023)."

1.A.1.10.5	"Voltage-sensitive Na+  channel, type 9, α-subunit, Nav1.7 or SCN9A (orthologous to 1.A.1.10.1).  Loss of function, resulting from point mutations, results in a channelopathy called Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIP) (He et al. 2018), that causes the congenital inability to experience pain (Cregg et al., 2010; Kleopa, 2011). An S241T mutation causes inherited erythromelalgia IEM; erythermalgia, an autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to mild warmth (due to altered gating) (Lampert et al., 2006; Drenth and Waxman, 2007). Gain-of-function mutations in the Na(v)1.7 channel lead to DRG neuron hyperexcitability associated with severe pain, whereas loss of the Na(v)1.7 channel in patients leads to indifference to pain (Dib-Hajj et al., 2007). Blocked by 1-benzazepin-2-one (Kd = 1.6 nM) (Williams et al., 2007). Mutations in the Nav1.7 Na  channel α-subunit give rise to familial pain syndromes called chronic non-paoxysmal neuropathic pain (Catterall et al., 2008; Fischer and Waxman, 2010; Dabby et al. 2011 ). It interacts with the sodium channel beta3 (Scn3b), rather than the beta1 subunit, as well as the collapsing-response mediator protein (Crmp2) through which the analgesic drug lacosamide regulates Nav1.7 current (Kanellopoulos et al. 2018). The R1488 variant is totally inactive (He et al. 2018). Nav1.7 is inhibited by knottins (see TC# 8.B.19.2) (Agwa et al. 2018). Nav1.7 interacts with the following proteins: syn3b (TC# 8.a.17.1.2; the β3 subunit), Crmp2, Syt2 (Q8N9I0) and Tmed10 (P49755), and it also regulates opioid receptor efficacy (Kanellopoulos et al. 2018). Mutations in TRPA1 and Nav1.7 to  insensitivity to pain-promoting algogens such as 
capsaicin, acid, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), have been documented (Eigenbrod et al. 2019). Nav1.7 is associated with endometrial cancer (Liu et al. 2019) and fever-associated seizures or epilepsy (FASE) (Ding et al. 2019). Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 peripheral nerve sodium channels are modulated by protein kinases A and C (Vijayaragavan et al. 2004). Sodium channel NaV1.7 and potassium channel KV7.2 promote and oppose excitability in nociceptors, respectively. Inflammation differentially controls transport
 of depolarizing Nav versus hyperpolarizing Kv channels to drive rat 
nociceptor activity (Higerd-Rusli et al. 2023). The structural basis for severe pain, caused by mutations in the S4-S5 linkers of voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, have been revealed (Wisedchaisri et al. 2023)."	Animals

Nav1.6 is the dendritic, voltage-gated sodium channel (responsible for dendritic excitability (Lorincz and Nusser, 2010)). Nav1.6 (SCN8A) interacts with microtubule-associated protein (O'Brien et al., 2012). Scorpion alpha toxins bind at receptor site-3 and inhibit channel inactivation, whereas beta toxins bind at receptor site-4 and shift the voltage-dependent activation toward more hyperpolarizing potentials (Gurevitz, 2012).  Mutations give rise to epileptic encephalopathy and intellectual disability (O'Brien and Meisler 2013).  A gain-of-function mutation gave rise to increased channel activation and infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Estacion et al. 2014). Benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS), paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), and
their combination - known as infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA) - are
related autosomal dominant diseases involving SCN8A (Gardella et al. 2015).  Mutations can lead to chronic movement disorder in the mouse (Jones et al. 2016), and loss of function mutations in humans can lead to intellectual disability without seizures (Wagnon et al. 2017). Nav1.6 has been quantitated in mouse brain and proved to be present in 2-fold decreased amounts in epileptic mice (Sojo et al. 2019). SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy results in intractable seizures including spasms, focal seizures, neonatal status epilepticus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (Kim et al. 2019). Mutations in the SCN8A gene causes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Pan and Cummins 2020). Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that binds to the anesthetic binding site in the α-subunit of the channel protein (Wang et al. 2004). A heterobivalent ligand (mu-conotoxin KIIIA, which occludes the pore of 
the NaV channels, and an analogue of huwentoxin-IV, a spider-venom 
peptide that allosterically modulates channel gating (TC#8.B.3.1.3)) 
slows ligand dissociation and enhances potency (Peschel et al. 2020). Several 
FDA‑approved drugs that are highly correlated with Nav1.6 could be 
candidate drugs for patients with glioma (Ai et al. 2023). Clinical and electrophysiological features of SCN8A variants cause episodic or chronic ataxia (Lyu et al. 2023). Epilepsy can be due to variants of the SCN8A gene (Zhang et al. 2024)."	Animals

saxitoxin, and the unusual slow open-state inactivation of NaV1.9 is mediated by the isoleucine-phenylalanine-methionine inactivation motif located in the linker connecting domains
III and IV (Goral et al. 2015).  Gain-of function mutations can lead to heritable pain disorders, and painful small-fibre neuropathy (Han et al. 2016). It is a threshold channel that regulates action potential firing, and is preferentially expressed in myenteric neurons, the small-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion neurons including nociceptors. There is a monogenic Mendelian link of Nav1.9 to human pain disorders including episodic pain due to a N816K mutation (Huang et al. 2019).

1.A.1.11.10	Plasma membrane voltage-gated, high affinity Ca2+ channel, Cch1/Mid1; activated by mating pheromones and environmental stresses; required for growth in low Ca2+ (Locke et al., 2000; Paidhungat and Garrett, 1997). Also essential for tolerance to cold stress and iron toxicity (Peiter et al., 2005). Ecm7, (448aas; 4 TMS; TC# 1.H.1.4.6), a member of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 Claudin superfamily of transmembrane proteins that includes gamma-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels appears to interact with Mid1 TC# 8.A.41.1.1) and regulate the activity of the Cch1/Mid1 channel (Martin et al., 2011). Ecm7p is related to members of TC families 1.H.1, 1.H.2 and 1.A.81. The two indispensable subunits, Cch1 and Mid1 are equivalent to the mammalian pore-forming α1 and auxiliary α2 /δ subunits, respectively. Cho et al. 2016 screened candidate proteins that interact with Mid1 and identified the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, Pma1 (TC#3.A.3.3.6). Mid1 co-immunoprecipitated with Pma1. At the nonpermiss, and Mid1-EGFP colocalized with Pma1-mCherry at the plasma membrane.  Using a temperature-sensitive mutant, pma1-10, the membrane potential was less negative, and Ca2+ uptake was lower than in wild-type cells. Thus, Pma1 interacts physically with Cch1/Mid1 Ca2+ channels to enhance their activity via its H+-pumping activity (Cho et al. 2016).	Yeast
1.A.1.11.11	"The Cav1.4 L-type Ca2+ channel (gene CACNA1F). Mutations resulting in increased activity cause x-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) (Hemara-Wahanui et al., 2005; Peloquin et al., 2007).  Aland Island eye disease (AIED), also known as Forsius-Eriksson syndrome, is an X-linked
recessive retinal disease characterized by a combination of fundus hypopigmentation, decreased
visual acuity, nystagmus, astigmatism, protan color vision defect, progressive myopia, and defective
dark adaptation. Since the clinical picture of AIED is
quite similar to CSNB2, these disorders are allelic or form a
single entity. Thus, AIED is also caused by CACNA1F gene
mutations (Jalkanen et al. 2007). Cav1.4 calcium channels play roles in the pathophysiology of psoriasis (Pelletier and Savignac 2022). Cav1.4 L-type calcium channels are predominantly expressed at the 
photoreceptor terminals and in bipolar cells, mediating neurotransmitter
 release. Mutations in its gene, CACNA1F, can cause congenital stationary night-blindness type 2 (CSNB2). Water wires in both, resting and active channel states have been proposed (Heigl et al. 2023)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.12	"T-type Ca2+ channel (CACNA1G; Cav3.1d), (σ1G T-type Ca2+ channel) in developing heart (fetal myocardium (Cribbs et al., 2001)) and elsewhere. Both Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 are permeated by divalent metal ions, such as Fe2+ and Mn2+, and possibly Cd2+ (Thévenod, 2010).  CaV3.1 channels are activated at low votage and regulate neuronal excitability in the spinal cord (Canto-Bustos et al. 2014).  It is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and the RanBPM protein (Q96S59) (Kim et al. 2009).  T-type calcium channels belong to the ""low-voltage activated (LVA)"" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channel is an opening at quite negative potentials and voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells, and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle (Coutelier et al. 2015). The human ortholog is 85% identical to the mouse protein. These channels also determines the angiogenic potential of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (Zheng et al. 2019)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.13	Two-pore Ca2+ channel protein 1, TPC1 (Km(Ca2+))=50 µM; voltage gated; 461 aas; 12 TMSs) (Hashimoto et al., 2004; Kurusu et al, 2004; 2005). Each TPC subunit contains 12 TMSs that can be divided into two homologous copies of an S1-S6 Shaker-like 6-TMS domain. A functional TPC channel assembles as a dimer. The plant TPC channel is localized in the vacuolar membrane and is also called the SV channel for generating the slow vacuolar (SV) current. Three subfamilies of mammalian TPC channels have been defined - TPC1, 2, and 3 - with the first two being ubiquitously expressed in animals and TPC3 being expressed in some animals, but not in humans. Mammalian TPC1 and TPC2 are localized to endolysosomal membranes (She et al. 2022).	Plants

1.A.1.11.15	"Neuronal nonselective cation channel, NALCN (forms background leak conductance and controls neuronal excitability; Lu et al., 2007).  It is also found in the pancreatic β-cell (Swayne et al. 2010). NALCN serves as a variable
sensor that responds to calcium or sodium ion flux, depending on whether the total cellular current
density is generated more from calcium-selective or sodium-selective channels (Senatore and Spafford 2013). It functions in a complex with Unc80 (3258 aas; Q8N2C7) and Unc79 (2635 aas; Q9P2D8) (Bramswig et al. 2018). Heterozygous de novo NALCN missense variants in the S5/S6 pore-forming 
segments lead to congenital contractures of the limbs and face, 
hypotonia, and developmental delay (Bramswig et al. 2018). Overexpression of the NALCN gene ablates allyl isothiocyanate-promoting pain reception by nociceptors (Eigenbrod et al. 2019)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.16	4 domain-type voltage-gated ion channel, α-1 subunit NCA-2 (Jospin et al., 2007) (dependent on Unc-80 (3225aas; CAB042172) for proper localization).	Animals
1.A.1.11.17	The high affinity Ca2+ channel; associates with elongation factor 3 (EF3) to target Cch1/Mid1 to the plasma membrane (Liu and Gelli, 2008).	Fungi
1.A.1.11.18	"The nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)- dependent two pore Ca2+- channel, TPC3 (Brailoiu et al., 2010). Phosphoinositides regulate dynamic movement of the S4 voltage sensor in the second repeat in two-pore channel 3 (Hirazawa et al. 2021). Each TPC subunit contains 12 TMSs that can be divided into two homologous
 copies of an S1-S6 Shaker-like 6-TMS domain. A functional TPC channel 
assembles as a dimer. The plant TPC channel is localized in the vacuolar
 membrane and is also called the SV channel for generating the slow 
vacuolar (SV) current. Three subfamilies of mammalian TPC channels have 
been defined - TPC1, 2, and 3 - with the first two being ubiquitously 
expressed in animals and TPC3 being expressed in some animals, but not 
in humans. Mammalian TPC1 and TPC2 are localized to endolysosomal 
membranes (She et al. 2022)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.19	"The phosphoinositide (PI(3,5)P2)-activated Na+ two pore channel-2, TPC2, in endosomes and lysosomes (Wang et al. 2012). Previously thought, incorectly, according to Wang et al. 2012, to be a nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-dependent two pore Ca2+ channel.  TPC2, like TPC1, has a 12 TMS topology (two channel units) (Hooper et al., 2011). The two domains of human TPCs can insert into the membrane independently (Churamani et al., 2012).  Cang et al. (2013), showed that TPC1 and TPC2 together form an ATP-sensitive two-pore Na+ channel that senses the metabolic state of the cell.  The channel complex detects nutrient status, becomes constitutively open
 upon nutrient removal, and controls the lysosome's membrane potential, pH stability, 
and amino acid homeostasis.  Essential for Ebola virus (EBOV) host entry. Several inhibitors of TPC2 that
 act in the nM (tetrandrine) or μM (verapamil; Ned19) range block channel activity, prevent Ebola Virus from escaping cell vesicles and may be 
used to treat the disease (Sakurai et al. 2015).  TPC2 may transport both Na+ and Ca2+ (Sakurai et al. 2015). Lipid-gated monovalent ion fluxes, mediated by TPC1 and TPC2 in mice, regulate endocytic traffic and support immune surveillance. This is in part achieved by catalyzing Na+ export from visicles derived from the plasma membrane by phagocytosis or pinocytosis, causing contraction and allowing the maintenance of a uniform cell volume (Freeman et al. 2020). This system is important for melanocyte function (Wiriyasermkul et al. 2020)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.2	Muscle plasmalemma, voltage-gated, L-type dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channel, α-1 subunit (DHPR) (Ba2+ > Ca2+), Cav1.1, CACNA1S,CACH1 CDCN1, CACNL1A3 of 1873 aas in the human orthologue.  Distinc voltage sensor domains control voltage sensitivity and kinetics of current activation (Tuluc et al. 2016). Rapid changes in the transmembrane potential are detected by the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), embedded in the sarcolemma. DHPR transmits the contractile signal to another Ca2+ channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), embedded in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which releases a large amounts of Ca2+ from the SR that initiate muscle contraction (Shishmarev 2020).

1.A.1.11.22	"The phosphoinositide (PI(3,5)P2)-activated Na+ two pore channel-1, TPC1 of endosomes and lysosomes (Wang et al. 2012). Previously thought, incorectly, according to Wang et al. (2012), to be an NAADP-activated two pore voltage-dependent calcium channel protein.  However, Cang et al. (2013), showed that TPC1 and TPC2 (TC# 1.A.1.11.19) together form an ATP-sensitive two-pore Na+ channel that senses the metabolic state of the cell.  The channel complex detects nutrient status, becomes constitutively open
 upon nutrient removal, and controls the lysosome's membrane potential, pH stability, 
and amino acid homeostasis.  May be regulated by the HCLS-associated X-1 (HAX-1) protein (Lam et al. 2013). The cryoEM 3-D structure has been ellucidated (She et al. 2018). This voltage-dependent, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2)-activated Na+ channel was solved in both the apo closed state and ligand-bound open state. The channel has a coin-slot-shaped ion pathway in the filter that defines the selectivity of mammalian TPCs. Only the voltage-sensing domain from the second 6-TMS domain confers voltage dependence while endolysosome-specific PtdIns(3,5)P2 binds to the first 6-TMS domain and activates the channel under conditions of depolarizing membrane potential. Structural comparisons between the apo and PtdIns(3,5)P2-bound structures show the interplay between voltage and ligand activation. These MmTPC1 structures reveal lipid binding and regulation in a 6-TMS voltage-gated channel (She et al. 2018)."	Animals

1.A.1.11.24	Voltage-sensitive calcium channel of 2693 aas (Docampo et al. 2013). Found to be essential for bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei through a genome-wide RNAi screen (Schmidt et al. 2018).	Euglenozoa (Protozoa)
1.A.1.11.25	"Endosomal/lysosomal, two pore Na+and Ca2+-release channel  (Na+> Ca2+) protein of 816 aas and 12 TMSs, TPC1 or TPCN1 (Guo et al. 2017).  Endosomes and lysosomes
are electrically excitable organelles (Cang et al. 2014). In a subpopulation of endolysosomes, a brief electrical
stimulus elicits a prolonged membrane potential depolarization spike. The organelles have a depolarization-activated, non-inactivating Na+ channel (lysoNaV). The
channel is formed by a two-repeat six-transmembrane-spanning (2x6 TMS) protein, TPC1, which represents
the evolutionary transition between 6 TMS and 4x6 TMS voltage-gated channels. Luminal alkalization also
opens lysoNaV by markedly shifting the channel's voltage dependence of activation toward
hyperpolarization. Thus, TPC1 is a voltage-gated Na+ channel that senses
pH changes and confers electrical excitability to organelles (Cang et al. 2014). Essential for Ebola virus (EBOV) host entry.  Several inhibitors act in the nM (tetrandrine) or μM (verapamil; Ned19) range to block Na+ and Ca2+ channel activity, inhibit virus escape from membrane vesicles and may possibly be used to treat the disease (Sakurai et al. 2015). A cluster of arginine residues in the first domain required for selective voltage-gating of TPC1 map not to the voltage-sensing fourth transmembrane region (S4) but to a cytosolic downstream region (S4-S5 linker). These residues are conserved between TPC isoforms suggesting a generic role in TPC activation. Accordingly, mutation of residues in TPC1 but not the analogous region in the second domain prevents Ca2+ release by NAADP in intact cells (Patel et al. 2017). Dramatic conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains communicate directly with the VSD during activation (Kintzer et al. 2018).  PGRMC1 (the progesterone receptor membrane component1), an ER transmembrane protein that undergoes a unique heme-dependent dimerization, is an interactor of the endosomal two pore channel, TPC1. It regulates ER-endosomal coupling with functional implications for cellular Ca2+ dynamics (Gunaratne et al. 2023)."	Animals
1.A.1.11.26	"Two pore Ca2+ > Na+, Li+ or K+ (non-selective for these three monovalen caions) channel protein of 733 aas and 12 TMSs, TPC1 (Guo et al. 2017). The crystal structure of this vacuolar two-pore channel, a homodimer, has been solved (Guo et al. 2015) (Kintzer and Stroud 2016). Activation requires both voltage and cytosolic Ca2+.
Ca2+ binding to the cytosolic EF-hand domain triggers conformational changes coupled to the pair of
pore-lining inner helices from the first 6-TMS domains, whereas membrane potential only activates the
second voltage-sensing domain, the conformational changes of which are coupled to the pair of inner
helices from the second 6-TMS domains. Luminal Ca2+ or Ba2+ modulates voltage activation by
stabilizing the second voltage-sensing domain in the resting state and shift voltage activation
towards more positive potentials. The basis for understanding ion permeation,
channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory ion-binding sites is partially explained by the 3-d structure (Kintzer and Stroud 2016). Only the second Shaker domain senses voltage (Jaślan et al. 2016). It has a selectivity filter that is passable by hydrated divalent cations (Demidchik et al. 2018). Dickinson et al. 2022 determined structures at different stages along its activation coordinate. These structures of activation intermediates, when compared with the resting-state structure, portray a mechanism in which the voltage-sensing domain undergoes dilation and in-membrane plane rotation about the gating charge-bearing helix, followed by charge translocation across the charge transfer seal. These structures, in concert with patch-clamp electrophysiology, showed that residues in the pore mouth sense inhibitory Ca2+ and are allosterically coupled to the voltage sensor. These conformational changes provide insight into the mechanism of voltage-sensor domain activation in which activation occurs vectorially over a series of elementary steps (Dickinson et al. 2022).  Inhibition of the Akt/PKB kinase increases Nav1.6-mediated currents and neuronal excitability in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Marosi et al. 2022)."

1.A.1.11.27	"Voltage-dependent P/Q-type Ca2+ channel subunit α1A, CACNA1A (CACH4; CACN3; CACNL1A4) of 2,505 aas. The CACNA1A gene is widely expressed throughout the CNS. The encoding protein is 90% identical to 1.A.1.11.8.  Associated with four neurological phenotypes: familial and sporadic hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1, SHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) and epileptic encephalopathy with nerve atrophy (Reinson et al. 2016). A gain of function mutation gave symptoms of congenital ataxia, abnormal eye movements and developmental delay with severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine (García Segarra et al. 2014). Mutations can cause F/SHM with high penitrance (Prontera et al. 2018). CACNA1A variants lead to a wide spectrum of neurological disorders including epileptic or non-epileptic paroxysmal events, cerebellar ataxia, and developmental delay. The variants are either gain of function GOF) or loss of function (LOF) mutations (Zhang et al. 2020). CACNA1A pathogenic variants have been linked to several neurological disorders including severe early onset developmental encephalopathies and cerebellar atrophy. Y1384 variants exhibit differential splice variant-specific effects on recovery from inactivation (Gandini et al. 2021). Patients with CACNA1A mutational variants located in the transmembrane region may be at high risk of status epilepticus (Niu et al. 2022). Patients with ataxia in the absence of epilepsy can be caused by a CACNA1A mutationand respond to pyridoxine (Du et al. 2017). lamotrigine can be used to treat patients with refractory epilepsy due to calcium channel mutations (Hu et al. 2022; De Romanis and Sopranzi 2018). Eupatilin depresses glutamate exocytosis from cerebrocortical synaptosomes by decreasing P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and synapsin I phosphorylation and alleviates glutamate 
excitotoxicity caused by kainic acid by preventing glutamatergic alterations in 
the mamalian cortex. Thus, eupatilin is a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of brain 
impairment associated with glutamate excitotoxicity (Lu et al. 2022)."	Animals

VDCC of Caenorhabditis elegans
1.A.1.11.29	"Voltage-gated calcium channel (VDCC) of 3097 aas and 24 TMSs, Cav7 (Wheeler and Brownlee 2008). The photoreceptor potential in Chlamydomonas triggers the generation of all or no flagellar Ca2+ currents that cause membrane depolarization across the eyespot and 
flagella (Sanyal et al. 2023). Modulation in membrane potential causes changes in the 
flagellar waveform, and hence, alters the beating patterns of 
Chlamydomonas flagella. The eyespot membrane potential is 
rhodopsin-mediated and is generated by the photoreceptor Ca2+ current or P-current. However, flagellar Ca2+ currents are mediated by unidentified voltage-gated calcium (VGCC or 
CaV) and potassium channels (VGKC). The voltage-dependent ion channel 
that associates with ChRs to generate Ca2+ influx across the 
flagella and its cellular distribution has been 
identified. Sanyal et al. 2023 presented evidence on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii predicting that CrVGCC4 
localizes to the eyespot and flagella and associates 
with channelrhodopsins. Further in silico interactome analysis of 
CrVGCCs suggested that they interact with photoreceptor 
proteins, calcium signaling, and intraflagellar transport components. 
Expression analysis indicated that these VGCCs and their putative 
interactors can be perturbed by light stimuli. Thus, VGCCs in general, and VGCC4 in particular, might be 
involved in the regulation of the phototactic response of Chlamydomonas."	Cav7 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
1.A.1.11.3	Voltage-dependent R-type Ca2+ channel, α-1E subunit (Cav2.3) (brain Ca2+ channel type II) (Ca2+ > Ba2+). Interacts with V-type ATPases (3.A.2), specifically, the G1-subunit, to regulate its activity (Radhakrishnan et al., 2011).  Syntaxin-3 (Syn-3) interacts directly with Cav2.3 to regulate its activity (Xie et al. 2016).  A Cav3.2 calcium channel missense variant is associated with epilepsy and hearing loss (Stringer et al. 2023).

CaV1.3-R990H channels conduct omega-currents at hyperpolarizing potentials, but not upon membrane depolarization compared with wild-type channels (Monteleone et al. 2017).

1.A.1.11.32	"Pore-forming, alpha-1S subunit of the 
voltage-gated calcium channel, of 1873 aas and 24 TMSs, Cav1.1; CACNA1S; CACN1; CACH1; CACNL1A3, that gives rise to L-type calcium currents
 in skeletal muscle. Calcium channels containing the alpha-1S subunit 
play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal 
muscle via their interaction with RYR1, which triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcplasmic reticulum and ultimately results in muscle 
contraction. Long-lasting (L-type) calcium channels belong to the 
'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group (Jiang et al. 2018). The 3-d structure of a bacterial homologue has been solved (Jiang et al. 2018). Mutations in arginly residues in the TMS4 voltage lead to increased leak currently that may be responsible for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (Kubota et al. 2020). Mutations in the voltage sensor domain of CaV1.1, the alpha1S subunit of the L-type calcium channel in skeletal muscle cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP), and these mutations give rise to gating pore currents (Wu et al. 2021). The voltage-gated T-type calcium channel is modulated by kinases and phosphatases (Sharma et al. 2023). Advances in CaV1.1 gating, dealing with permeation and voltage-sensing mechanisms, have been reviewed (Bibollet et al. 2023). It is possible to prevent calcium leak associated with short-coupled polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in patient-derived cardiomyocytes (Sleiman et al. 2023). Far-infrared ameliorates Pb-induced renal toxicity via voltage-gated calcium channel-mediated calcium influx (Ko et al. 2023).

1.A.1.11.36	Two pore segment channel 1 of 790 aas and 12 TMSs in a 3 + 3 (N-terminal half) + 2 + 2 + 2 (C-terminal half) TMS arrangement. In the trunk of developing zebrafish embryos, adjacent myotome blocks transmit contractile force via myoseptal junctions (MJs), dynamic structures that connect the actin cytoskeleton of skeletal muscle cells to extracellular matrix components via transmembrane protein complexes in the sarcolemma. Rice et al. 2022 reported that the endolysosomal ion channel, TPC1, generates highly localized, non-propagating Ca2+ transients that play a distinct and required role in the capture and attachment of superficial slow skeletal muscle cells (SMCs) at MJs. Disruption of the tpcn1 gene resulted in abnormal MJ phenotypes including SMCs detaching from or crossing the myosepta. TPC1-decorated endolysosomes are dynamically associated with MJs in a microtubule-dependent manner, and  attenuating tpcn1 expression or function disrupted endolysosomal trafficking and resulted in an abnormal distribution of beta-dystroglycan (a key transmembrane component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex). Thus, localized TPC1-generated Ca2+ signals facilitate essential endolysosomal trafficking and membrane contact events, which help form and maintain MJs following the onset of SMC contractile activity (Rice et al. 2022).

1.A.1.11.4	"The voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel α-subunit-1C (L-type Cav1.2), CACNA1C (CACH2, CACN2, CACNL1A1, CCHL1A1) of 2221 aa. Mutations cause Timothy's syndrome, a disorder associated with autism (Splawski et al., 2006). The C-terminus of Cav1.2 encodes a transcription factor (Gomez-Ospina et al., 2006). Cav1.2 associates with the α-2, δ-1, β and γ subunits (Yang et al., 2011). The CRAC channel activator STIM1 binds and inhibits L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav1.2 (Park et al., 2010).  This channel appears to function as the molecular switch for synaptic transmission (Atlas 2013). Intramembrane signalling occurs with syntaxin 1A for catecholamine release in chromaffin cells (Bachnoff et al. 2013).  miR-153 intron RNA is a negative regulator of both insulin and dopamine secretion through its effect on Cacna1c
expression, suggesting that IA-2beta and miR-153 have opposite functional effects on the
secretory pathway (Xu et al. 2015).   Co-localizes with Syntaxin-1A in nano clusters at the plasma membrane (Sajman et al. 2017). It is a high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel in contrast to Cav3.3 which is a low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel (Sanchez-Sandoval et al. 2018). Nifedipine blocks and potentiates this and other L-type VIC Ca2+ channels (Wang et al. 2018).  Cav1.2 is upregulated when STIM1 is deficient (Pascual-Caro et al. 2018). CaV1.2 regulates chondrogenesis during limb development (Atsuta et al. 2019). CACNA1C may be a prognostic predictor of survival in ovarian cancer (Chang and Dong 2021). Kinase and phosphatase modulation of T-type Ca2+ channel (TTCC) isoforms Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and 
Cav3.3, are mostly described for roles unrelated to cellular 
excitability (Sharma et al. 2023), and potential modulations that are 
yet to be explored are also discussed. Palmitoylation of the pore-forming subunit of Ca(v)1.2 controls channel voltage sensitivity and calcium transients in cardiac myocytes (Kuo et al. 2023).  A novel binding site between the voltage-dependent calcium channel CaV1.2 subunit and the CaVβ2 subunit has been discovered using a new analysis method for protein-protein interactions (Murakami et al. 2023). CACNA1C is one of the top risk genes for schizophrenia;   A novel 17-variant block across introns 36-45 of CACNA1C was significantly associated with schizophrenia; a novel 17-variant block across introns 36-45 of CACNA1C was responsible (Guo et al. 2023). A novel binding site has been found between the voltage-dependent calcium channel CaV1.2 subunit and CaVβ2 subunit (Murakami et al. 2023)."	Animals

For the studies of ion permeation and Ca2+  blockage, see Derebe et al., 2011. (structures: 3LDD_A and 2OGU_A.). Voltage-dependent K+  channels including MthK which lacks a canonical voltage sensor can undergo a gating process known as C-type inactivation, which involves entry into a nonconducting state through conformational changes near the channel's selectivity filter (Thomson and Rothberg, 2010). C-type inactivation may involve movements of transmembrane voltage sensor domains. In the absence of Ca2+, a single structure in a closed state was observed by cryoEM that was highly flexible with large rocking motions of the gating ring and bending of pore-lining helices (Fan et al. 2020). In Ca2+-bound conditions, several open-inactivated conformations were present with the different channel conformations being distinguished by rocking of the gating rings with respect to the transmembrane region. In all conformations displaying open channel pores, the N-terminus of one subunit of the channel tetramer sticks into the pore and plugs it. Deletion of this N terminus led to non-inactivating channels with structures of open states without a pore plug, indicating that this N-terminal peptide is responsible for a ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism (Fan et al. 2020). Lipid-protein interactions influence the conformational equilibrium between two states of the channel that differ according to whether a TMS has a kink. Two key residues in the kink region mediate crosstalk between two gates at the selectivity filter and the central cavity, respectively. Opening of one gate eventually leads to closure of the other (Gu and de Groot 2020). Activation of MthK is exquisitely regulated by temperature (Jiang et al. 2020).	Euryarchaea

YugO is in a two cistronic operon where Mistic (MstX; 9.A.66; Debnath et al., 2011; Roosild et al., 2005) is encoded by the gene that precedes yugO. Both play a role in biofilm formation, probably by functioning together (Lundberg et al. 2013; Marino et al. 2015). These K+ channels in bacterial biofilms provide an active, long-range electrical signalling for cellular communities (Prindle et al. 2015).  Metabolic co-dependency gives rise to collective electrical oscillations in biofilms (Liu et al. 2015). This oscillatory electrical signalling, due to periodic release of K+, giving rise to K+ gradients, increasing as swimming cells approach the biofilm that generates the gradiens, allows cells of the same and different speices to find and then incorporate themselves into existing biofilms (Humphries et al. 2017).

Arginine residues in the S4 segment play a role in voltage-sensing (Chahine et al. 2004). Transmembrane and extramembrane regions contribute to thermal stability (Powl et al., 2012). Deprotonation of arginines in S4 is involved in NaChBac gating (Paldi, 2012). Hinge-bending motions in the pore domain of NaChBac have been reported (Barber et al., 2012).  The C-terminal coiled-coli stabilizes subunit interactions (Mio et al. 2010).  Within the 4 TMS voltage sensor, coupling between residues in S1 and S4 determines its resting conformation (Paldi and Gurevitz 2010). The conserved asparagine was changed to aspartate, N225D, and this substitution shifted the voltage-dependence of inactivation by 25 mV to more hyperpolarized potentials. The mutant also displays greater thermostability (O'Reilly et al. 2017).  Possibly, the side-chain amido group of asn225 forms one or more hydrogen bonds with different channel elements, and  these interactions are important for normal channel function. The T1-tetramerization domain of Kv1.2 (TC# 1.A.1.2.10) rescues expression and preserves the function of a truncated form of the NaChBac sodium channel (D'Avanzo et al. 2022). The structure of NaChBac embedded in liposomes has been solved by cryo electron tomography (Chang et al. 2023). The small channel has most of its residues embedded in the membrane, and these are flexible, determining the channel dimensions.	Gram-positive bacteria

Jiang et al. 2018 presented high-resolution structures of NavAb with the analogous gating-charge mutations that have similar functional effects as in the human channels that cause hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis.  Wisedchaisri et al. 2019 presented a cryo-EM structure of the resting state and a complete 
voltage-dependent gating mechanism via the voltage sensor (VS). The S4 segment of the VS is drawn 
intracellularly, with three gating charges passing through the 
transmembrane electric field. This movement forms an elbow connecting S4
 to the S4-S5 linker, tightens the collar around the S6 activation gate,
 and prevents its opening. This structure supports the classical ""sliding

mechanism for voltage sensor function, pore opening, and activation-gate
 closure based on high-resolution structures of a single sodium channel

KCNE3 can co-assemble with KCNQ1 (1.A.1.15.6) (Kang et al., 2010). KCNQ1 regulates insulin secretion in  the MIN6 beta-cell line (Yamagata et al., 2011).  The S4-S5 linker of KCNQ1 forms a scaffold with S6 controlling gate closure (Labro et al. 2011).  The KCNQ1 channel is differentially regulated by KCNE1 and KCNE2 (Li et al. 2014.  Slow-activating channel complexes formed by KCNQ1 and KCNE1 are

channels are important in the intestine. Inherited sequence variants in human KCNE1 and KCNE3 cause
cardiac arrhythmias but by different mechanisms, and each is important for hearing in unique ways (Abbott 2015). The topology and dynamics of the voltage sensor domain of KCNQ1 reconstituted in a lipid bilayer environment has been studied (Dixit et al. 2019).  KCNQ1 (Kv 7.1) alpha-subunits and KCNE1 beta-subunits co-assemble to form channels that conduct the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) in the heart. Mutations in either subunit cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited disorder of cardiac repolarization (Seebohm et al. 2005). KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1 potassium channel activation by an allosteric mechanism (Kuenze et al. 2020).

Like all other Kv7.2 channels, it is activated by phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate and hence can be regulated by various neurotransmitters and hormones (Telezhkin et al. 2013).  Gating pore currents that go through the gating pores in TMSs1-4 (the voltage sensor) may give rise to peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (Moreau et al. 2014).

Almost 300 mutations of KCNQ1 have been identified in patients, and most are linked to the long QT syndrome (LQT1), some in the voltage sensor (Peroz et al., 2008; Eldstrom et al. 2010; Qureshi et al. 2013; Ikrar et al. 2008). KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes may interact intermittently with the actin cytoskeleton via the C-terminal region (Mashanov et al., 2010). The stoichiometry of the KCNQ1 - KCNE1 complex is flexible, with up to four KCNE1 subunits associating with the four KCNQ1 subunits of the channel (Nakajo et al., 2010). A familial mutation in the voltage-sensor of the KCNQ1 channel results in a cardiac phenotype (Henrion et al., 2012). KCNQ1 regulates insulin secretion in  the MIN6 beta-cell line (Yamagata et al., 2011; Gofman et al., 2012).  Electrostatic interactions of S4 arginines with E1 and S2 contribute to gating movements of S4, but coupling requires the

The KCNQ1 channel interacts with MinK (KCNE1) to cause pore constriction, generating the slow delayed rectifier (IKs) current in the heart (Jalily Hasani et al. 2018). KCNQ1 rescues TMC1 plasma membrane expression but not mechanosensitive channel activity (Harkcom et al. 2019). Activation of the neuronal Kv7/KCNQ/M-current represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for treatment of hyperexcitability-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, pain, and depression, and channel openers for treatment of antiepilepsy have been developed (Zhang et al. 2019). The relationship between mutation locations in KCNQ1, which is a major gene in long QT syndrome (LQTS), and phenotype has been analyzed and used for risk stratification (Yagi et al. 2018). The proximal C-terminal regions of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 participate in a physical and functional interaction during channel opening that is sensitive to perturbation (Chen et al. 2019). Retigabine analogs are activators of Kv7 channels (Ostacolo et al. 2020). People with borderline QTc prolongations were carriers of KCNQ1 mutations in TMSs 2 and 5, leading to haploinsufficiency, and they are potentially at risk of developing drug-induced arrhythmia (Gouas et al. 2004). Collision induced unfolding differentiates functional variants of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor domain (Fantin et al. 2020). The activated KCNQ1 channel promotes a fibrogenic response in hereditary gingival fibromatosis via clustering and activation of Ras (Gao et al. 2020). QT syndrome (LQTS) increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia in young individuals with structurally normal hearts. It may involve sixteen genes such as the KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A (Lin et al. 2020). The human KCNQ1 voltage sensing domain (VSD) has been studied in lipodisq nanoparticles by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Sahu et al. 2020). Structural mechanisms for the activation of the human cardiac KCNQ1 channel by electro-mechanical coupling enhancers have been reviewed (Ma et al. 2022). The pathogenicity of KCNQ1 variants  using zebrafish as a model has been reviewed (Cui et al. 2023). Phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is required for coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore of the potassium voltage-gated KV7 channel family, especially the KV7.1 channel. Modulation of the I(KS) channel by PIP2 requires two binding sites per monomer (Kongmeneck et al. 2023).  Divergent regulation of the KCNQ1/E1 channel can be accomplished by targeted recruitment of protein kinase A to distinct sites on the channel complex (Zou et al. 2023).  Rare missense variants with a clear phenotype of Long QT Syndrome, type 1 (LQTS) have a high likelihood to be present within the pore and adjacent TMSs (S5-Pore-S6) (Novelli et al. 2023).  LHFPL5 is a key element in force transmission from the tip link to the hair cell mechanotransducer channel (Beurg et al. 2024)."

The same is true for SK3 (K(Ca) 2.3 (Q9UGI6)). Regulates endothelial vascular function (Sonkusare et al., 2012).  Distinct subcellular mechanisms enhance the surface membrane expression by its interacting proteins, α-actinin 2 (TC# 8.A.66.1.3) and filamin A (TC# 8.A.66.1.4) (Zhang et al. 2016). SK channel activators can compensate for age-related changes of the
autorhythmic functions of the cerebellum (Karelina et al. 2017). SK2 proteins are more abundant in Purkinje cells than in the ventricular myocytes of normal rabbit ventricles (Reher et al. 2017). Apamin inhibits and isoproterenol activates this and other SK (KCNN) channels, and activation by isoproterenol is sex-dependent (Chen et al. 2018).  Diverse interactions between KCa and TRP channels integrate cytoplasmic Ca2+, oxidative, and electrical signaling affecting cardiovascular physiology and pathology (Behringer and Hakim 2019). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). A non-neuronal hSK3 isoform has a dominant-negative effect on hSK3 currents (Wittekindt et al. 2004).

It is inhibited by 1 μM arachidonate which binds in the pore (Hamilton et al., 2003)). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B) activates KCa3.1 via histidine phosphorylation, resulting in receptor-stimulated Ca2+ flux and T cell activation (Di et al., 2010). It regulates endothelial vascular function (Sonkusare et al., 2012).  Tissue-specific expression of splice variants of the orthologous rat KCNN4 protein have been reported (Barmeyer et al. 2010).  Residues involved in gating have been identified (Garneau et al. 2014). It is also present in the inner mitochondrial membrane where increases of
mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] cause mtKCa3.1 opening, thus linking inner membrane K+ permeability and transmembrane potential to Ca2+ signalling (De Marchi et al. 2009). KCa3.1 (IKCa) channels are expressed in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal
cells and contribute to the slow afterhyperpolarization that regulates spike accommodation (Turner et al. 2016).  SK channel activators can compensate for age-related changes of the
autorhythmic functions of the cerebellum (Karelina et al. 2017). The activation mechanism has been revealed by the cryoEM structure of the SK4-calmodulin complex (Lee and MacKinnon 2018).  It is responsible for hyperpolarization in some tumor cells (Lazzari-Dean et al. 2019). Mutations are linked to dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (xerocytosis) (Andolfo et al. 2015). This channel is present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). KCNN4 promotes the progression of lung adenocarcinoma by activating the AKT and ERK signaling pathways (Xu et al. 2021). KCa3.1 channels in human microglia link extracellular ATP-evoked Ca2+ transients to changes in membrane conductance with an inflammation-dependent mechanism, and suggests that during brain inflammation, the KCa3.1-mediated microglial response to purinergic signaling may be reduced (Palomba et al. 2021).

 Activation is followed by membrane hyperpolarization and is thought to 
regulate neuronal excitability by contributing to the slow component of 
synaptic after-hyperpolarization. The channel is blocked by apamin. Contrary to its bradycardic effect in the sinus node, blockage of its current by apamin accelerates ventricular automaticity and causes repeated, nonsustained, ventricular tachycardia in normal ventricles. Ryanodine receptor 2 blockage reversed the apamin effects on ventricular automaticity (Wan et al. 2019). Dextran sodium sulfate treatment causes loss of transient relaxation due to downregulation of SK3 channels and may increase contractile responses due to increased Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle cells via protease-activated receptor_1 (PAR1) [TC# P25116; TC# 9.A.14.13.37] activation (Sung et al. 2022).

1.A.1.17.1	"The archaeal voltage-regulated K  channel, KvAP (Ruta et al., 2003). X-ray and solution structures are available. The latter shows phospholipid interactions with the isolated voltage sensor domain (Butterwick and MacKinnon 2010; Li et al. 2014). The gating-charge arginine in TMS4 of the voltage sensor forms part of the helical hairpin ""paddle"", and it moves 15-20 Å through the membrane to open the pore (Ruta et al., 2005). The orientation and depth of insertion of the voltage-sensing S4 helix has been determined (Doherty et al., 2010). A synthetic S6 segment derived from the KvAP channel self-assembles, permeabilizes lipid vesicles, and exhibits ion channel activity in bilayer lipid membrane (Verma et al., 2011).  Thus the gating mechanism combines structural rearrangements and electric-field remodeling ( Li et al. 2014).  KvAP has been reconstituted in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) (Garten et al. 2015).  TMS4 (S4) which senses voltage also promotes membrane insertion of the voltage-sensor domain (Mishima et al. 2016). KvAP has a configuration consistent with a water channel, possibly underlying the conductance of protons, and other cations, through voltage-sensor domains (Freites et al. 2006). The structural dynamics of the paddle motif loop in the activated conformation of the KvAP voltage sensor have been studied from biophysical standpoints (Das et al. 2019). The S4 alpha-helix, which is straight in the experimental crystal structure solved under depolarized conditions (Vm approximately 0), breaks into two segments when the cell membrane is hyperpolarized (Vm << 0) and reversibly forms a single straight helix following depolarization (Vm = 0) ((Bignucolo and Bernèche 2020). The outermost segment of S4 translates along the normal to the membrane, bringing new perspective to previously paradoxical accessibility experiments that were initially thought to imply the displacement of the whole VSD across the membrane. The breakage of S4 under (hyper)polarization could be a general feature of Kv channels with a non-swapped topology. The surface charge of the membrane does not significantly affect the topology and structural dynamics of the sensor loop in membranes (Das and Raghuraman 2021). The dynamic variability of the sensor loop is preserved in both zwitterionic (POPC) and anionic (POPC/POPG) lipid membranes. The lifetime distribution analysis for the NBD-labelled residues by the maximum entropy method (MEM) demonstrates that, in contrast to micelles, the membrane environment not only reduces the relative discrete population of sensor loop conformations, but also broadens the lifetime distribution peaks. The local curvature of cellular membranes acts as a driving force for the targeting of membrane-associated proteins to specific membrane domains, as well as a sorting mechanism for transmembrane proteins, as demonstrated for KvAP (Kluge et al. 2022)."

Czirjak et al. 2008 reported that 14-3-3 proteins directly bind to the intracellular loop to TRESK and control the kinetics of the calcium-dependent regulation. Cloxyquin (5-chloroquinolin-8-ol) is an activator (Wright et al. 2013).  A cytoplasmic loop binds tubulin (Enyedi et al. 2014). Channel activity is modified by phosphorylation (inactive) and dephosphorylation (active) of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2nd and 3rd TMS (Lengyel et al. 2018).  The distal short intracellular C-terminal region (iCtr) following the fourth TMS is a major positive determinant of TRESK function (Debreczeni et al. 2023).

1.A.1.19.1	"Alkalinizatioin-activated Ca2+-selective channel, sperm-associated cation channel, CatSper, required for male fertility and the hyperactivated motility of spermatozoa (Kirichok et al. 2006). These channels require auxiliary subunits, CatSperβ, γ and δ for activity (Chung et al., 2011).  The primary channel protein is CatSper1 (Liu et al., 2007), and it
may be a target for immunocontraception (Li et al. 2009). CatSper channels have been reported to regulate
sperm motility (Vicente-Carrillo et al. 2017). Sperm competition is selective for a disulfide-crosslinked macromolecular architecture. CatSper channel opening occurs in response to pH, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and mechanical force. A flippase function is hypothesized, and a source of the concomitant disulfide isomerase activity is found in CatSper-associated proteins beta, delta and epsilon (Bystroff 2018). More recently, it has been reported that rotational motion and rheotaxis of human sperm do not require functional CatSper channels or transmembrane Ca2+ signaling (Schiffer et al. 2020). Instead, passive biomechanical and hydrodynamic processes may enable sperm rolling and rheotaxis, rather than calcium signaling mediated by CatSper or other mechanisms controlling transmembrane Ca2+ flux. The Ca2+ channel CatSper is not activated by cAMP/PKA signaling but directly affected by chemicals used to probe the action of cAMP and PKA (Wang et al. 2020). The cation channel of sperm (CatSper) is essential for sperm motility and fertility. CatSper comprises the pore-forming proteins CATSPER1-4 and multiple auxiliary subunits, including CATSPERbeta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and EFCAB9. Lin et al. 2021 reported the cryo-EM structure of the CatSper complex isolated from mouse sperm. CATSPER1-4 conform to the conventional domain-swapped voltage-gated ion channel fold, following a counterclockwise arrangement. The auxiliary subunits CATSPERbeta, gamma, delta and epsilon - each of which contains a single transmembrane segment and a large extracellular domain - constitute a pavilion-like structure that stabilizes the entire complex through interactions with CATSPER4, 1, 3 and 2, respectively. The EM map revealed several previously uncharacterized components, exemplified by the organic anion transporter SLCO6C1. Lin et al. 2021 named this channel-transporter ultracomplex the CatSpermasome. The assembly and organizational details of the CatSpermasome lay the foundation for the development of CatSpermasome-related treatments for male infertility and non-hormonal contraceptives. CatSper is a target for inhibition, for use in male contraception, causing inhibition of sperm motility (Mariani et al. 2023).

It functions with the auxiliary subunit, Ivβ1.2; 8.A.5.1.1) (Peters et al. 2009).  Delemotte et al. (2010) described the effects of sensor domain mutations on molecular dynamics of Kv1.2.  The Sigma 1 receptor (Q99720; Sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1) interacts with Kv1.2 to shape neuronal and behavioral responses to cocaine (Kourrich et al. 2013).  Amino acid substitutions cause Shaker to become heat-sensing (opens with increasing temperature as for TrpV1) or cold-sensing (opens with decreasing temperature as for TrpM8) (Chowdhury et al. 2014).  The Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the 4th transmembrane
helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD) which showed altered gating kinetics and formed a
cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons (Zhao and Blunck 2016).  Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1/Cx29 (TC# 1.A.24.1.12) channel 
interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active
 role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory
conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian 
myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). A cryoEM structure (3 - 4 Å resolution; paddle chimeric channel; closed form) in nanodiscs has been determined (Matthies et al. 2018). Possible gating mechanisms have been discussed (Kariev and Green 2018; Infield et al. 2018). Pathogenic variants in KCNA2, encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2, have been identified as the cause for an evolving spectrum of neurological disorders. Affected individuals show early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and movement disorders resulting from cerebellar dysfunction (Döring et al. 2021). In addition, individuals with a milder course of epilepsy, complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, and episodic ataxia have been reported. Biophysical properties of a delayed rectifier K+ current can contribute to its role ingenerating spontaneous myogenic activity (Hu et al. 2021). The local curvature of cellular membranes acts as a driving force for 
the targeting of membrane-associated proteins to specific membrane 
domains, as well as a sorting mechanism for transmembrane proteins, as 
demonstrated for the chimeric channel, Kv1.2/2.1; KvChim induces a strong positive membrane curvature (Kluge et al. 2022). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) has inhibitory effects on three KV1 channels, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 (Zhao et al. 2023). Voltage-gated K+ channels have two distinct gates that regulate ion flux: the activation gate (A-gate) formed by the bundle crossing of the S6 transmembrane helices and the slow inactivation gate in the selectivity filter. These two gates are bidirectionally coupled. Szanto et al. 2023 suggested that the coupling between the A-gate and the slow inactivation gate is mediated by rearrangements in the S6 segment. S6 rearrangements are consistent with a rigid rod-like rotation of S6 around its longitudinal axis upon inactivation."	Animals
1.A.1.2.11	Voltage-gated K+ channel, Shab-related, Kv2.1 or KCNB1 (858aas) The crystal structure is known (Long et al., 2007). Rat Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 (long) are colocalized in the somata and proximal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons and are capable of forming functional heteromeric delayed rectifier channels. The delayed rectifer currents, which regulate action potential firing, are encoded by heteromeric Kv2 channels in cortical neurons (Kihira et al., 2010). Phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase regulates membrane excitability (Ikematsu et al., 2011). Functional interactions between residues in the S1, S4, and S5 domains of Kv2.1 have been identified (Bocksteins et al., 2011).  Missense variants in the ion channel domain and loss-of-function variants in this domain and the C-terminus cause neurodevelopmental disorders, sometimes with seizures (de Kovel et al. 2017).  Kv2.1 channels consist of two types of alpha-subunits: (1) electrically-active Kcnb1 alpha-subunits and (2) silent or modulatory alpha-subunits plus beta-subunits that, similar to silent alpha-subunits, regulate electrically-active subunits (Jędrychowska and Korzh 2019). It plays a role  in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of the alpha-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of hetero-tetrameric potassium channels. Kcnb1-containing channels are involved in brain development and reproduction. Modification of Kv2.1 K+ currents is mediated by the silent Kv10 subunits (Vega-Saenz de Miera 2004). The clinical expression of KCNB1 encephalopathy is variable (Púa-Torrejón et al. 2021). Variants of KCNB1, located in the S1 segment, may be associated with a milder outcome of seizures (Hiraide et al. 2022). Altered neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes have been observed in a mouse model of the recurrent KCNB1 -p.R306C voltage-sensor variant (Kang et al. 2023). A point mutation (M340I) in KV2.1 may cause severe and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (trOCD) (Chen et al. 2023; Ji et al. 2023).It may play a role in Parkinson's Disease (Zhou et al. 2023).

It is regulated by syntaxin (TC family 8.A.91) through dual action on channel surface expression and conductance (Feinshreiber et al., 2009). Defects cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant K+ channelopathy accompanied by short
attacks of cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria (D'Adamo et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2020). Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1/Cx29 channel 
interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active
 role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory
conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian 
myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). Kv1.1 is present in bull sperm where it is necessary for normal sperm progressive motility, percent capacitated spermatozoa (B-pattern) and the acrosome reaction (Gupta et al. 2018). Gating induces large aqueous volumetric remodeling (Díaz-Franulic et al. 2018). Paulhus et al. 2020 have reviewed the pathology of mutants in this protein and showed that epilepsy or seizure-related variants tend to cluster in the S1/S2 transmembrane domains and in the pore region of Kv1.1, whereas EA1-associated variants occur along the whole length of the protein, but variants at the C-terminus are more likely to suffer from seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders (Yuan et al. 2020). Mutation in KCNA1 has been identified that impairs voltage sensitivity (Imbrici et al. 2021). Altering expression of the genes encoding Kv1.1, Piezo2, and TRPA1 regulate the response of mechanosensitive muscle nociceptors (Nagaraja et al. 2021). Genetic variants have expanded the functional, molecular, and pathological diversity of KCNA1 channelopathies (Paulhus and Glasscock 2023). Carbamazepine suppresses the impaired startle response and brain hyperexcitability in kcna1a(-/-) zebrafish but had no effect on the seizure frequency in Kcna1(-/-) mice, suggesting that this EA1 zebrafish model might better translate to humans than rodents (Dogra et al. 2023)."

It is negatively modulated by protein kinase C (Desai et al., 2008). Phosphorylation of Kv3.3 by PKC may allow neurons to maintain action potential height during stimulation at high frequencies, and therefore contributes to stimulus-induced changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons such as those of the auditory brainstem (Desai et al., 2008).  N-glycosylation impacts the sub-plasma membrane localization and activity of Kv3.1b-containing channels, and N-glycosylation processing of Kv3.1b-containing channels contributes to neuronal excitability (Hall et al. 2017). Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia, involves the abnormal expansion of repeat sequences as well as the mutation of K+ and Ca2+ channel genes (Tada et al. 2020).

Control of transport (pore) function  by the voltage sensor may involve more than one mechanism (Tomczak et al. 2017).  The silent (non transporting) behaviour of Kv6.3 in the ER is caused by the C-terminal part of its sixth transmembrane domain that causes ER retention (Ottschytsch et al. 2005).  De novo missense variants in KCNH1 encoding Kv10.1 are responsible for two clinically recognisable phenotypes: Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TBS) and Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) (Aubert Mucca et al. 2022). The clinical overlap between these two syndromes suggests that they belong to a spectrum of KCNH1-related encephalopathies.

1.A.1.2.4	Margatoxin-sensitive voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.3 (in plasma and mitochondrial membranes of T lymphocytes) (Szabò et al., 2005). Kv1.3 associates with the sequence similar (>80%) Kv1.5 protein in macrophage forming heteromers that like Kv1.3 homomers are r-margatoxin sensitive (Vicente et al., 2006). However, the heteromers have different biophysical and pharmacological properties. The Kv1.3 mitochondrial potassium channel is involved in apoptotic signalling in lymphocytes (Gulbins et al., 2010). Interactions between the C-terminus  of Kv1.5 and Kvβ regulate pyridine nucleotide-dependent changes in channel gating (Tipparaju et al., 2012).  Intracellular trafficking of the KV1.3 K+ channel is regulated by the pro-domain of a matrix metalloprotease (Nguyen et al. 2013).  Direct binding of caveolin regulates Kv1 channels and allows association with lipid rafts (Pérez-Verdaguer et al. 2016). Addtionally, NavBeta1 interacts with the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of Kv1.3 through W172 in the transmembrane segment to modify the gating process (Kubota et al. 2017). During insertion of Kv1.3, the extended N-terminus of the second α-helix, S2, inside the ribosomal tunnel is converted into a helix in a transition that depends on the nascent peptide sequence at specific tunnel locations (Tu and Deutsch 2017). The microRNA, mmumiR449a, reduced the mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), and calcium activated potassium channel subunit alpha1 (KCNMA1) and increased the level of transmembrane phosphatase with tension homology (TPTE) in the DRG cells (Lu et al. 2017). This channel is regulation by sterols (Balajthy et al. 2017). Loss of function causes atrial fibrillation, a rhythm disorder characterized by chaotic electrical activity of cardiac atria (Olson et al. 2006). The N-terminus and S1 of Kv1.5 can attract and coassemble with the rest of the channel (i.e. Frag(304-613)) to form a functional channel independently of the S1-S2 linkage (Lamothe et al. 2018). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). Kv1.3 plays an essential role in the immune response mediated by leukocytes and is functional at both the plasma membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane. Plasma membrane Kv1.3 mediates cellular activation and proliferation, whereas mitochondrial Kv1.3 participates in cell survival and apoptosis (Capera et al. 2022). Kv1.3 uses the TIM23 complex to translocate to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This mechanism is unconventional because the channel is a multimembrane spanning protein without a defined N-terminal presequence. Transmembrane domains cooperatively mediate Kv1.3 mitochondrial targeting involving the cytosolic HSP70/HSP90 chaperone complex as a key regulator of the process (Capera et al. 2022).	Animals
1.A.1.2.5	"Voltage-gated K+ channel subfamily D, member 2, Kv4.2 or KCND2, in neurons and muscle; forms complexes with auxiliary subunits and scaffolding proteins via its N-terminus, influencing trafficking, temperature-sensitivity and gating (Radicke et al. 2013).These subunits are (1) dipeptidyl-peptidase-like type II transmembrane proteins typified by DPPX-S (e.g., protein 6, P42658; 865 aas, TC#8.A.51),
and (2) cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding proteins known as K+ channel interacting proteins (KChIPs; TC#8.A.82.2.2; Q6PIL6) (Seikel and Trimmer 2009).  The C-terminus interacts with KChIP2 to influence gating, surface trafficking and gene expression (Han et al., 2006; Schwenk et al., 2008). KChIPs (250 aas for mouse KChIP4a; Q6PHZ8) are homologous to domains in NADPH oxidases (5.B.1). Heteropoda toxin 2 (P58426; PDB 1EMX; TC#8.B.5.2.2) interactions with Kv4.3 and Kv4.1 give rise to differences in gating modifications (DeSimone et al., 2011).  Mutations cause autism and seizures due to a slowing of channel inactivation (Lee et al. 2014).  The stoichiometry of Kv4.2 and DPP6 is 4:4 (Soh and Goldstein 2008). Neferine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from plants, inhibits Kv4.3 channels, probably by blocking the open state (Wang et al. 2015). SUMOylating (derivatizing with a small ubiquitin-like modifier) at two distinct sites on Kv4.2 increases surface expression and decreases current amplitude (Welch et al. 2019). Modulation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels by auxiliary subunits is central to the physiological function of channels in the brain and heart. Native Kv4 tetrameric channels form macromolecular ternary complexes with two auxiliary beta-subunits-intracellular Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) and transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase-related proteins (DPPs)-to evoke rapidly activating and inactivating A-type currents, which prevent the backpropagation of action potentials (see above). Kise et al. 2021 investigated the modulatory mechanisms of Kv4 channel complexes, reporting cryo-EM structures of the Kv4.2-DPP6S-KChIP1 dodecameric complex, the Kv4.2-KChIP1 and Kv4.2-DPP6S octameric complexes, and Kv4.2 alone. The structure of the Kv4.2-KChIP1 complex revealed that the intracellular N terminus of Kv4.2 interacts with its C-terminus that extends from the S6 gating helix of the neighbouring Kv4.2 subunit. KChIP1 captures both the N and the C terminus of Kv4.2. Thus, KChIP1 prevents N-type inactivation and stabilizes the S6 conformation to modulate gating of the S6 helices within the tetramer. Unlike the reported auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated channel complexes, DPP6S interacts with the S1 and S2 helices of the Kv4.2 voltage-sensing domain, which suggests that DPP6S stabilizes the conformation of the S1-S2 helices. DPP6S may therefore accelerate the voltage-dependent movement of the S4 helices. KChIP1 and DPP6S do not directly interact with each other in the Kv4.2-KChIP1-DPP6S ternary complex. Thus, two distinct modes of modulation contribute in an additive manner to evoke A-type currents from the native Kv4 macromolecular complex (Kise et al. 2021)."	Animals

Shaker K+ channels can be mutated in S4 to create an analogous ""omega"" pore (Held et al. 2018). The NMR structure of the isolated Shaker voltage-sensing domain in LPPG micelles has been reported (Chen et al. 2019). Substituting the first S4 arginine with a smaller amino acid opens a high-conductance pathway for solution cations in the Shaker K+ channel at rest. The cationic current does not flow through the central K+ pore and is influenced by mutation of a conserved residue in S2, suggesting that it flows through a protein pathway within the voltage-sensing domain (Tombola et al. 2005). The current can be carried by guanidinium ions, suggesting that this is the pathway for transmembrane arginine permeation. Tombola et al. 2005 proposed that when S4 moves, it ratchets between conformations in which one arginine after another occupies and occludes to ions in the narrowest part of this pathway. Specific resin acids activate and open voltage-gated channels  dependent on its exact binding dynamics (Silverå Ejneby et al. 2021).

1.A.1.20.1	"K+  voltage-gated ether-a-go-go-related channel, H-ERG (KCNH2; Erg; HErg; Erg1, Kv11.1) subunit Kv11.1 (long QT syndrome type 2) (Gong et al., 2006; Chartrand et al. 2010; McBride et al. 2013). Selective expression of HERG and Kv2 channels influences proliferation of uterine cancer cells (Suzuki and Takimoto 2004). H-ERG forms a heteromeric K+  channel regulating cardiac repolarization, neuronal firing frequency and neoplastic cell growth (Szabó et al., 2011).  Oligomerization is due to N-terminal interactions between two splice variants, hERG1a and hERG1b (Phartiyal et al., 2007). Structure function relationships of ERG channel activation and inhibition have been reviewed (Durdagi et al., 2010). Interactions between the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane core modulate hERG K  channel gating (Fernández-Trillo et al., 2011). The marine algal toxin azaspiracid is an open state blocker (Twiner et al., 2012). Verapamil blocks channel activity by binding to Y652 and F656 in TMS S6 (Duan et al. 2007).  Hydrophobic interactions between the voltage sensor and the channel domain mediate inactivation (Perry et al. 2013), but voltage sensing by the S4 segment can be transduced to the channel gate in the absence of
physical continuity between the two modules (Lörinczi et al. 2015).  Mutations give rise to long QT syndrome (Osterbur et al. 2015).  Polyphenols such as caffeic acid, phenylethyl ester (CAPE) and curcumin inhibit by modification of gating, not by blocking the pore (Choi et al. 2013). Potassium ions
can inhibit tumorigenesis through inducing apoptosis of hepatoma cells by upregulating potassium
ion transport channel proteins HERG and VDAC1 (Xia et al. 2016).  Incorrectly folded hERG can be degraded by Bag1-stimulated Trc-8-dependent proteolysis (Hantouche et al. 2016). The S1 helix regulates channel activity. Thus, S1 region mutations reduce both the action potential repolarizing current passed by Kv11.1 channels in cardiac myocytes, as well as the current passed in response to premature depolarizations that normally helps protect against the formation of ectopic beats (Phan et al. 2017). Interactions of beta1 integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulate distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 (Becchetti et al. 2017). ERG1 is sensitive to the alkaloid, ginsenoside 20(S) Rg3 which alters the gating of hERG1 channels by interacting with and stabilizing the voltage sensor domain in an activated state (Gardner et al. 2017). Channels split at the S4-S5 linker, at the intracellular S2-S3 loop, and at the extracellular S3-S4 loop are fully functional channel proteins (de la Peña et al. 2018). IKr is the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, the ion current largely responsible for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Inherited forms of long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans are linked to functional modifications in the Kv11.1 (hERG) ion channel and potentially life threatening arrhythmias. hERG1b affects the generation of the cardiac Ikr and plays an important role in cardiac electrophysiology (Perissinotti et al. 2018). X-ray crystallography and cryoEM have revealed features of the ""nonswapped"" transmembrane architecture, an ""intrinsic ligand,"" and small hydrophobic pockets off a pore cavity. Drug block and inactivation mechanisms are discussed (Robertson and Morais-Cabral 2019). It forms a complex with β-integrin (TC#9.B.87.1.25) and NHE1 (TC# 2.A.36.1.13) (Iorio et al. 2020). Cardiotoxicity is caused mainly by the inhibition of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel protein which leads to a life-threatening condition known as cardiac arrhythmia and is due to probable collapse of the pore. (Koulgi et al. 2021). Transmembrane hERG channel currents have been measured based on solvent-free lipid bilayer microarrays (Miyata et al. 2021). A computational method for identifying an optimal combination of existing drugs to repair the action potentials of SQT1 ventricular myocytes has been published (Jæger et al. 2021). Ginsenoside Rg3 may be a promising cardioprotective agent against vandetanib-induced QT interval prolongation through targeting hERG channels (Zhang et al. 2021). Insight has been obtained into the potassium currents of hERG (Guidelli 2023). Two novel KCNH2 mutations contribute to long QT syndrome (Owusu-Mensah et al. 2024). Channel activity is affected by moxifloxacin, terfenadine, arsenic, pentamidine, erythromycin, and sotalol (Goineau et al. 2024)."	Animals (Mammals)

Cysteines control the N- and C-linker-dependent gating of KCNH1 potassium channels  (Sahoo et al., 2012).  The 3-d structure has been determined at 3.8 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-EM with calmodulin bound. The structure suggests a novel mechanism of voltage-dependent gating. Calmodulin binding closes the potassium pore (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016). Eag1 has three intracellular domains: PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD. Whicher and MacKinnon 2019 demonstrated that the Eag1 intracellular domains are not required for voltage-dependent gating but likely interact with the VS to modulate gating. Specific interactions between the PAS, CNBHD, and VS domains modulate voltage-dependent gating, and VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening. Mutations affecting these interactions render Eag1 insensitive to calmodulin inhibition (Whicher and MacKinnon 2019). The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains, and calmodulin may prevent this rotation by stabilizing interactions between the VS and the other intracellular domains. Intracellular domains likely play a similar modulatory role in voltage-dependent gating of the related Kv11-12 channels. The human ortholog, EAG or EAG-1, is 989 aas long and is 95% identical to the rat protein.  In ether-a-go-go K+ channels, voltage-dependent activation is modulated by ion binding to a site located in an extracellular-facing crevice between transmembrane segments S2 and S3 in the voltage sensor. Silverman et al. 2004 found that acidic residues, D278 in S2 and D327 in S3, are able to coordinate a variety of divalent cations, including Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+, which have qualitatively similar functional effects, but different half-maximal effective concentrations.

1.A.1.3.1	"Large conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK or Slo) channel. Four pairs of RCK1 and RICK2 domains form the Ca2+-sensing apparatus known as the ""gating ring"" in Big Potassium (BK) channel proteins (Savalli et al., 2012). Gating of BK channels does not seem to require a physical gate. Instead, changes in the pore shape and surface hydrophobicity in the Ca2+-free state allow the channel to readily undergo hydrophobic dewetting transitions, giving rise to a large free energy barrier for K+ permeation (Jia et al. 2018).  Voltage-dependent dynamics of the BK channel cytosolic gating ring are coupled to the membrane-embedded voltage sensor (Miranda et al. 2018). Slo channels  are targets for insecticides and antiparasitic drugs. Raisch et al. 2021 reported structures of Drosophila Slo in the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms and in complex with the fungal neurotoxin verruculogen and the anthelmintic drug emodepside. The architecture and gating mechanism of Slo channels are conserved, but potential insect-specific binding pockets are present. Verruculogen inhibits K+ transport by blocking the Ca2+-induced activation signal and precludes K+ from entering the selectivity filter while emodepside decreases the conductance by suboptimal K+ coordination and uncouples ion gating from Ca2+ and voltage sensing (Raisch et al. 2021). In neurosecretion, allosteric communication between voltage sensors and Ca2+ binding in BK channels is crucially involved in damping excitatory stimuli. Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al. 2022 demonstrated that two arginines in the transmembrane segment S4 (R210 and R213) function as the BK gating charges. The energy landscape of the gating particles is electrostatically tuned by a network of salt bridges contained in the voltage sensor domain (VSD)."	Animals
1.A.1.3.10	"Calcium-, magnesium- and voltage-activated K+ channel, Slo1 (Kcma1; KCNMA, KCNMA1), a BK channel, of 1236 aas and 6 N-terminal TMSs. Its activation dampens the excitatory events that elevate the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and/or depolarize the cell membrane. It therefore 
contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential, and it plays a key 
role in controlling excitability in a number of systems. Ethanol and carbon monoxide-bound heme increase channel activation while heme inhibits channel activation (Tang et al. 2003). The molecular structures of the human Slo1 channel in complex with beta4 has been solved revealing four beta4 subunits, each containing two transmembrane helices, encircling Slo1, contacting it through helical interactions inside the membrane. On the extracellular side, beta4 forms a tetrameric crown over the pore. Structures with high and low Ca2+ concentrations show that identical gating conformations occur in the absence and presence of beta4, implying that beta4 serves to modulate the relative stabilities of 'pre-existing' conformations rather than creating new ones (Tao and MacKinnon 2019). BK channels show increased activities in Angelman syndrome due to genetic defects in the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene (Sun et al. 2019). It is a large-conductance potassium (BK) channel that can be synergistically and independently activated by membrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+. The only covalent connection between the cytosolic Ca2+-sensing domain and the TM pore and voltage sensing domains is a 15-residue 'C-linker' which plays a direct role in mediating allosteric coupling between BK domains (Yazdani et al. 2020).  Site specific deacylation by the alpha/beta acyl-hydrolase domain-containing protein 17A, ABHD17a (Q96GS6, 310 aas), controls BK channel splice variant activity (McClafferty et al. 2020). Compared with the structure of isolated hSlo1 Ca2+ sensing gating rings, two opposing subunits in hBK unfurled, resulting in a wider opening towards the transmembrane region of hBK. In the pore gate domain, two opposing subunits moved downwards relative to the two other subunits (Tonggu and Wang 2022). A gating lever, mediated by S4/S5 segment interactions within the transmembrane domain, rotates to engage and stabilize the open conformation of the S6 inner pore helix upon V sensor activation (Sun and Horrigan 2022). An indirect pathway, mediated by the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain (CTD) and C-linker connects the CTD to S6, and stabilizes the closed conformation when V sensors are at rest (Sun and Horrigan 2022). Co-dependent regulation of p-BRAF (TC# 8.A.23.1.48) and the potassium channel KCNMA1 levels drives glioma progression (Xie et al. 2023). Potassium channelopathies associated with epilepsy-related syndromes and directions for therapeutic interventionhave been reviewed (Gribkoff and Winquist 2023). The influx of Ca2+, mediated by the hypotonic-induced activation of mechanosensitive channels, is a key step for opening both the BK(Ca) and the IK(Ca) channels. The influx of Ca2+, mediated by the hypotonic-induced activation of mechanosensitive channels, is a key step for opening both the BK(Ca) and the IK(Ca) (TC# 1.A.1.16.2) channels (Michelucci et al. 2023).  Disease-associated KCNMA1 variants decrease circadian clock robustness in channelopathy mouse models (Dinsdale et al. 2023).  High-resolution structures illuminate key principles underlying voltage and LRRC26 regulation of Slo1 channels (Kallure et al. 2023)."	Kcma1 of Homo sapiens
1.A.1.3.2	"Large conductance or L-type Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+  channel (LTCC), α-subunit (subunit α1), BK, BKCa, Kca1.1, Slowpoke, Slo1, KCNMA1 or MaxiK (functions with four β-subunits (TC# 8.A.14) encoded by genes KCNMB1-4 and the γ subunit (TC# 8.A.43) in humans (Toro et al. 2013; Li et al. 2016); the positions of beta2 and beta3 have been determined (Wu et al. 2013).  The KB channel is inhibited by 3 scorpion toxins, charybda toxin, iberiotoxin and slotoxin.  It forms a ''Ca2+  nanodomain'' complex with Cav1.2 (L-type; 1.A.1.11.4), Cav2.1 (P/Q-type; 1.A.1.11.5) and Cav2.2 (N-type; 1.A.1.11.6) where Ca2+ influx through the Cav channel activates BKCa (Berkefeld et al., 2006; Romanenko et al., 2006). The RCK2 domain is a Ca2+ sensor (Yusifov et al., 2008). Binding of Ca2+ to D367 and E535 changes the conformation around the binding site and turns the side chain of M513 into a hydrophobic core, explaining how Ca2+ binding opens the activation gate of the channel (Zhang et al., 2010). A structural motif in the C-terminal tail of Slo1 confers carbon monoxide sensitivity to human BKCa channels (Williams et al., 2008; Hou et al., 2008). These channels are present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of rat brain (Douglas et al., 2006).The Stress-Axis Regulated Exon (STREX) is responsible for stretch sensitivity. Ca2+ binds to two sites. Ca2+ binding to the RCK1 site is voltage dependent, but Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+ bowl is not (Sweet and Cox et al., 2008). Type 1 IP3 receptors activate BKCa channels via local molecular coupling in arterial smooth muscle cells (Zhao et al., 2010). The open structure is known (Yuan et al., 2012). BKCa is essential for ER calcium uptake in neurons and cardiomyocytes (Kuum et al., 2012) and link Ca2+ signaling to action potential firing and neurotransmitter release via serotonin receptors in many types of neurons (Rothberg 2012). The molecular mechanism of pharmacological activation of BK channels has been discussed by Gessner et al. (2012). The first TMS of the β2-subunit binds to TMS S1 of the α-subunit (Morera et al., 2012).  Mutations in Cav1.2 give rise to Timothy syndrome (Dixon et al. 2012).  Exhibits low voltage activation by interaction with Cav3 (Rehak et al. 2013) as well as Ca2+-gating (Berkefeld and Fakler 2013). Single-channel kinetics have been reported (Geng and Magleby 2014). The γ-subunit has TC# 8.A.43.1.8.  RBK channels regulate myogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (Krishnamoorthy-Natarajan and Koide 2016). Latorre et al. 2017 reviewed molecular, physiological and pathological aspects of Slo1.  The microRNA, mmumiR449a, reduced the mRNA expression levels of 
transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 
(TRPA1), and calcium activated potassium channel subunit alpha1 (KCNMA1)
 and increased the level of transmembrane phosphatase with tension 
homology (TPTE) in the DRG cells (Lu et al. 2017), thereby reducing pain. The N-terminal sequence determines its modification by β-subunits (Lorca et al. 2017). Inhibition of BKCa negatively alters cardiovascular function (Patel et al. 2018). BKCa may be the target of verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin photosensitizer that alters membrane ionic currents (Huang et al. 2019). Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulates due to mutations in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A. Gb3 deposition in skin fibroblasts impairs KCa1.1 activity and activate the Notch1 signaling pathway, resulting in an increase in pro-inflammatory mediator expression, and thus, contributing to cutaneous nociceptor sensitization as a potential mechanism of FD-associated pain (Rickert et al. 2019). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). The Slo3 (TC# 1.A.1.3.5) cytosolic module confers pH-dependent regulation whereas the Slo1 cytosolic module confers Ca2+-dependent regulation (Xia et al. 2004). Elevated extracellular Ca2+ aggravates iron-induced neurotoxicity because LTCCs mediate iron transport in dopaminergic neurons and this, in turn, results in elevated intracellular Ca2+ and further aggravates iron-induced neurotoxicity (Xu et al. 2020). Agonists include BMS-191011, NS1619, NS11021, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid isoforms, while inhibitors include iberiotoxin and penitrem A which have been used to study the system in megakaryocytes and platelets (Balduini et al. 2021). Medicinal plant products can interact with BKCa (Rajabian et al. 2022)."	Animals
1.A.1.3.3	"Ca2+-activated K+ channel Slo-1 (Maxi K; BK channel) (ethanol-activated; responsible for intoxication) (Davies et al., 2003); tyrosyl phosphorylation regulates BK channels via cortactin (Tian et al. 2008a), but palmitoylation gates phosphorylation-dependent regulation of BK potassium channels (Tian et al., 2008b). Also regulated by Mg2+ which mediates interaction between the voltage sensor and cytosolic domain to activate BK channels (Yang et al., 2007). Modulated by the ss2 subunit (Lee et al., 2010). The structure of the gating ring from the human large-conductance Ca2+-gated K+ channel has been reported (Wu et al., 2010). Four pairs of RCK1 and RICK2 domains form the Ca2+-sensing apparatus known as the ""gating ring"" in BK channel proteins (Savalli et al., 2012).  The dystrophin (Q9TW65) dystrobrevin (Q9Y048) complex controls BK channel localization and muscle activity as well as neurotroansmitter release (Kim et al. 2009, Chen et al. 2011).  Syntrophin (Q93646) links various receptors and transporters to the actin cytoskeleton and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), and α-catulin (CTN-1; 759 aas, 0 TMSs) facilitates targeting. The BK channel is a tetramer where the pore-forming α-subunit contains seven transmembrane segments (González-Sanabria et al. 2021). It has a modular architecture containing a pore domain with a highly potassium-selective filter, a voltage-sensor domain and two intracellular Ca2+ binding sites at the C-terminus. BK is found in the plasma membrane of different cell types, the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoBK) and the nuclear envelope's outer membrane (nBK). Like BK channels in the plasma membrane (pmBK), the open probability of mitoBK and nBK channels are regulated by Ca2+ and voltage and modulated by auxiliary subunits. BK channels share common pharmacology to toxins such as iberiotoxin, charybdotoxin, paxilline, and agonists of the benzimidazole family (González-Sanabria et al. 2021)."	Animals
1.A.1.3.4	The one or two component intracellularly Na+ and Cl--activated delayed rectifier K+ channel, rSlo2.2 (Slack; KCNT1)/r Slo2.1 (Slick; KCNT2; TC# 1.A.1.3.6) provides protection against ischemia (Yuan et al., 2003). The N-terminal domain of Slack determines the formation and trafficking of Slick/Slack heteromeric sodium-activated potassium channels (Chen et al., 2009). Slick and Slack can also form separate homooligomeric channels. These channels are widely distributed in the mammalian CNS and they play roles in slow afterhyperpolarization, generation of depolarizing afterpotentials and in setting and stabilizing the resting potential (Rizzi et al. 2015). The small cytoplasmic protein beta-synuclein TC# 1.C.77.1.2) and the transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263; TC# 8.A.101.1.1) are interaction partners of both Slick and Slack channels. The inactive dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP 10) and the synapse associated protein 102 (SAP 102) are constituents of the Slick and Slack channel complexes (Rizzi et al. 2015).	Animals
1.A.1.3.5	Sperm Slo3 high conductance K+ channel, activated by voltage and intracellular alkalinization. In sperm, it gives rise to pH-dependent outwardly rectifying K+ currents. (required for the ensuing acrosome reaction; activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) (Tang et al., 2010). The Slo3 cytosolic module confers pH-dependent regulation whereas the Slo1 (TC# 1.A.1.3.2)  cytosolic module confers Ca2+-dependent regulation (Xia et al. 2004). When mammalian sperm are released in the female reproductive tract, they are incapable of fertilizing the oocyte. They need a prolonged exposure to the alkaline medium of the female genital tract before their flagellum gets hyperactivated and the acrosome reaction can take place, allowing the sperm to interact with the oocyte (de Prelle et al. 2022). Ionic fluxes across the sperm membrane are involved in two essential aspects of capacitation: the increase in intracellular pH and membrane hyperpolarization. The SLO3 potassium channel and the sNHE sodium-proton exchanger are necessary for the capacitation process to occur. As the SLO3 channel is activated by an increase in intracellular pH and sNHE is activated by hyperpolarization, they act together as a positive feedback system (de Prelle et al. 2022).	Animals

closed state (Suzuki et al. 2016). Despite their apparent high levels of expression, the activities of somatic KNa (Slo2.1 and Slo2.2) channels are tightly regulated by the activity of the Na+/K+ pump (Gray and Johnston 2021)."	Animals

Its requirements for both Cl- and Ca2+ are synergistic and associated with the same functional domain (Yuan et al. 2000) which serves to counteract hypoxia stress when cytoplasmic Cl- and Ca2+ concentrations increase (Yuan et al. 2003; Santi et al. 2003).  SLO2 protects from hypoxic injury by increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to K+ (Wojtovich et al. 2011).

1.A.1.4.1	K+ channel, AKT1; may form heteromeric channels with KC1 (TC # 1.A.1.4.9) (Geiger et al., 2009).  Required for seed development and postgermination growth in low potassium (Pyo et al. 2010).  Functions optimally with intermediate potassium concentrations (~1 mM) (Nieves-Cordones et al. 2014). In barley, it may play a role in drought resistance (Cai et al. 2019).  HAK/KUP/KT8, GrAKT2.1 and GrAKT1.1 potassium channels may function in response to abiotic stress in Gossypium raimondii (Azeem et al. 2021). Plants obtain nutrients from the soil via transmembrane transporters and channels in their root hairs, from which ions radially transport in toward the xylem for distribution across the plant body. Dickinson et al. 2021 determined structures of the hyperpolarization-activated channel, AKT1, from Arabidopsis thaliana, which mediates K+ uptake from the soil into plant roots. The structures of AtAKT1, embedded in lipid nanodiscs, show that the channel undergoes a reduction of C4 to C2 symmetry, possibly to regulate its electrical activation.	Plants

BLINK1 has been used to manipulate stomatal kinetics to improve carbon assimilation, water use, and growth of A. thaliana (Papanatsiou et al. 2019).	Synthetic light-sensitive K+ channel, BLINK2.

1.A.1.4.4	Guard cell outward rectifying K+ out channel, GORK, controls leaf stomatal pore opening (by increasing solute content) and closing (by decreasing solute content), which in turn controls gas and water loss (Schroeder, 2003). H2S signaling not only activates the ion channel proteins located in the guard cell membrane to induce stomatal closure, but also regulates the transcriptional expression and the activity of RuBisCO, a non-stomatal factor to enhance the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves. There is therefore a beneficial balance between the regulation of H2S signaling on stomatal factors and non-stomatal factors due to drought stress (Zhang et al. 2023).	Plants
1.A.1.4.5	Root stelar K+ outward rectifying channel, SKOR (involved in K+ release into the xylem sap; part of the plant water stress response) (Gaymard et al., 1998). SKOR is an outwardly rectifying K+ channel that mediates the delivery of K+ from stelar cells to the xylem in the roots, a critical step in the long-distance distribution of K+ from roots to the upper parts of the plant. Liu et al. 2006 and Johansson et al. 2006 reported that SKOR channel activity is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular K+ concentrations. Activation by K+ did not affect the kinetics of voltage dependence, indicating that a voltage-independent gating mechanism underlies K+ sensing. The C-terminal non-transmembrane region is required for sensing. The intracellular K+ sensing mechanism couples SKOR activity to the K+ status of the 'source cells', thereby establishing a supply-based unloading system for the regulation of K+ distribution (Liu et al. 2006; Johansson et al. 2006). SKOR may be involved in droght resistance in barley (Cai et al. 2019).	Plants
1.A.1.4.6	Heterotetrameric K+ channel, KAT2/AKT2/KCT2 (Nieves-Cordones et al. 2014). Forms heteromeric channels (2:2 stoichiometry) with KAT1 (1.A.1.4.7) (Lebaudy et al., 2010) (Properties differ from those of homomeric channels; Xicluna et al., 2007).  KAT2 also forms homomeric channels in the plasma membrane (Nieves-Cordones et al. 2014). AKT2 functions in phloem loading and unloading and operates as an inward-rectifying channel that allows H+-ATPase-energized K+ uptake. Through reversible post-translational modifications, it can also function as an open, K+-selective channel, providing energy for transmembrane transport processes. It is present in a complex of several proteins in which it interacts with the receptor-like kinase, MRH1/MDIS2 (Sklodowski et al. 2017). The ortholog in Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage), KCT2, is induced by stress. It has  a TxxTxGYGD motif in the P-domain and a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding-like domain within a long C-terminal region (Zhang et al. 2006). HAK/KUP/KT8, GrAKT2.1 and GrAKT1.1 potassium channels may function in response to abiotic stress in Gossypium raimondii (Azeem et al. 2021).	Plants
1.A.1.4.7	The voltage-sensitive inward rectifying K+ channel, KAT1 (similar to 1.A.1.4.3; activated by protein 14-3-3 (AAF87262)) (Sottocornola et al., 2006). May also transport Na+ and Cs+ (Nakamura and Gaber, 2009). Forms heterotetrameric channels with KAT2 with a stoichiometry of 2:2 (Lebaudy et al., 2010). The pH-sensor is built of a sensory cloud rather than of single key amino acids (Gonzalez et al., 2011). The transmembrane core region of KAT1 is important for its activity in S. cerevisiae, and this involves not only the pore region but also parts of its voltage-sensor domain (Saito et al. 2017). Electromechanical coupling and gating polarity in KAT1 displays a depolarized voltage sensor, which interacts with a closed pore domain directly via two interfaces and indirectly via an intercalated phospholipid. Direct interaction between the sensor and the C-linker hairpin in the adjacent pore subunit is the primary determinant of gating polarity (Clark et al. 2020). Possibly an inward motion of the S4 sensor helix of 5-7 Å underlies a direct-coupling mechanism, driving a conformational reorientation of the C-linker and ultimately opening the activation gate formed by the S6 intracellular bundle. KAT1, and presumably other hyperpolarization-gated plant CNBD channels, can open from an S4-down VSD conformation homologous to the divalent/proton-inhibited conformation of EAG family K+ channels (Zhou et al. 2021).

It forms a tripartite SNARE-K+ channel complex which regulates KAT3 channel opening (Honsbein et al., 2009).  Tripartite interactions with SNARE (SYP121; SYR1; PEN1) and AKT1 control gating (Grefen et al. 2010).  ZKC1 also forms homoleric channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (Nieves-Cordones et al. 2014).

1.A.1.5.10	"Orthologue K+/Na+ pacemaker channel, Hcn4 (Scicchitano et al., 2012).  Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated HCN channels underlie the Na+-K+ permeable
IH pacemaker current. As with other voltage-gated members of the 6-transmembrane KV channel
superfamily, opening of HCN channels involves dilation of a helical bundle formed by the
intracellular ends of S6, but this is promoted by inward, not outward, displacement of S4. Direct
agonist binding to a ring of cyclic nucleotide-binding sites, one of which lies immediately distal
to each S6 helix, imparts cAMP sensitivity to HCN channel opening. At depolarized potentials, HCN
channels are further modulated by intracellular Mg2+ which blocks the open channel pore and blunts
the inhibitory effect of outward K+ flux. Lyashchenko et al. 2014 showed that cAMP binding to the gating ring
enhances not only channel opening but also the kinetics of Mg2+ block.  Mutations in HCN4 cause sick sinus and the Brugada syndrome, cardiac abnormalities. HCN4 is associated with famiial sinus bradycardia (Boulton et al. 2017). Activation of Hcn4 by cAMP has been reviewed (Porro et al. 2020). The HCN1-4 channel family is responsible for the hyperpolarization-activated cation current If/Ih that controls automaticity in cardiac and neuronal pacemaker cells. Saponaro et al. 2021 presented cryo-EM structures of HCN4 in the presence or absence of bound cAMP, displaying the pore domain in closed and open conformations. Analysis of cAMP-bound and -unbound structures shed light on how ligand-induced transitions in the channel cytosolic portion mediate the effect of cAMP on channel gating and highlighted the regulatory role of a Mg2+ coordination site formed between the C-linker and the S4-S5 linker. Comparison of open/closed pore states shows that the cytosolic gate opens through concerted movements of the S5 and S6 transmembrane helices. Furthermore, in combination with molecular dynamics analyses, the open pore structures provide insights into the mechanisms of K+/Na+ permeation (Saponaro et al. 2021)."	Animals
1.A.1.5.11	"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) inward current-carrying cationic channel, I(f), (HCN2/HCN4) (Ye and Nerbonne, 2009).  Functional interactions between the HCN2 TM region and C-terminal region govern multiple CNB fold-mediated mechanisms, implying that the molecular mechanisms of autoinhibition, open-state trapping, and Quick-Activation include participation of TM region structures (Page et al. 2020). Rhythmic activity in pacemaker cells, as in the sino-atrial node in the heart, depends on the activation of HCN channels. As in depolarization-activated K+ channels, the fourth transmembrane segment S4 functions as the voltage sensor in hyperpolarization-activated HCN channels (Wu et al. 2021). S4 in HCN channels moves in two steps in response to hyperpolarizations, and the second S4 step correlates with gate opening (Wu et al. 2021). It is a nuclear hormone receptor that binds estrogens with an affinity similar to 
that of ESR1/ER-alpha, and activates expression of reporter genes 
containing estrogen response elements (ERE) in an estrogen-dependent 
manner (Koyama et al. 2010). It may lack
 ligand binding ability and has no or only very low ERE binding activity,
 resulting in the loss of ligand-dependent transactivation ability. Male moujse ejaculation drives sexual satiety and selectively activates Esr2neurons in the BNSTpr of both sexes (Zhou et al. 2023).  Changes in binding affinity, rather than changes in cAMP concentration, can modulate HCN channels (Porro et al. 2024)."

modular model of allosteric gating, according to which protein domains are quasi-independent: they
can move independently but are coupled to each other allosterically (Gofman et al. 2014). An intact S4 is required for proper protein folding and/or assembly involving two glycosylation sites in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Faillace et al. 2004).

An SthK C-linker domain is essential for coupling cyclic nucleotide binding to channel opening (Evans et al. 2020). An agonist-dependent conformational change in which residues of the B'-helix displayed outward movement with respect to the symmetry axis of the channel in the presence of cAMP was observed, but not with the partial agonist, cGMP. This conformational rearrangement was observed both in detergent-solubilized SthK and in channels reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. In addition to outward movement of the B'-helix, channel activation involves upward translation of the cytoplasmic domain with formation of state-dependent interactions between the C-linker and the transmembrane domain (Evans et al. 2020). Three-deminsional structures are available (7RSY_A-D). SthK is active in a sparsely tethered lipid bilayer membranes (Andersson et al. 2023).	Spirochaetes

1.A.1.5.2	Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel, HCN (bCNG-1) (PNa+/PK+ ≈ 0.3). The human orthologue (O88703) is 863 aas in length and also catalyzes mixed monovalent cation currents K+:Na+= 4:1 (Lyashchenko and Tibbs et al., 2008). Biel et al. (2009) presented a detailed review of hyperpolarization-activated cation-channels. They are inhibited by nicotine and epibatidine which bind to the inner pore (Griguoli et al., 2010). They control cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity. HCN channels contain cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) in their C-terminal regions, linked to the pore-forming transmembrane segment with a C-linker. The C-linker couples the conformational changes caused by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to the HCN pore opening. Cyclic dinucleotides antagonize the effect of cyclic nucleotides in HCN4 but not in HCN2 channels. Interaction of the C-linker/CNBD with other parts of the channel appears to be necessary for cyclic-dinucleotide binding in HCN4 channels (Hayoz et al. 2017). A conformational trajectory of allosteric gating of the human cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel has been documented (Hu et al. 2023).  The voltage-sensor rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases (Handlin and Dai 2023).  Opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance are driven by HCN ion channels (Han et al. 2024).

sensor-like domain and the pore domain, forming a gating ring that couples conformational changes
triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding to the gate. The selectivity filter is lined by the

1.A.1.5.29	"spHCN1 is a pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) non-selective cation channel of 767 aas and 6 TMSs that opens due to inward movement of the positive charges in the fourth TMS (S4). This channel is similar to a COOH-terminal-deleted HCN1 channel, suggesting that the main functional differences between spHCN and HCN1 channels are due to differences in their COOH termini (Vemana et al. 2004). These channels open after only two S4s have
moved, and S4 motion is rate limiting during voltage activation of spHCN channels (Bruening-Wright et al. 2007). HCN channels regulate electrical activity in the heart and brain. Distinct from mammalian isoforms, the sea urchin (spHCN) channel exhibits strong voltage-dependent inactivation in the absence of cAMP (Idikuda et al. 2018). The voltage sensor undergoes a large downward motion during hyperpolarization (Dai et al. 2019). Sea urchin HCN1 and 2 (TC# 1.A.1.5.33) (spHCN) channels undergo inactivation with hyperpolarization which occurs only in the absence of cyclic nucleotide (Dai et al. 2021). Removing cAMP produces a largely rigid-body rotation of the C-linker relative to the transmembrane domain, bringing the A' helix of the C-linker in close proximity to the voltage-sensing S4 helix. In addition, rotation of the C-linker is elicited by hyperpolarization minus cAMP. Thus, in contrast to electromechanical coupling for channel activation - the A' helix serves to couple the S4-helix movement for channel inactivation, which is likely a conserved mechanism for CNBD-family channels (Dai et al. 2021)."

1.A.1.5.3	"Heterotetrameric (3A:1B) rod photoreceptor cyclic GMP-gated cation channel, CNGA1 or CNCG or CNCG1 (Zhong et al., 2002) of 686 aas and 6 TMSs. Cyclic nucleotides are required to open the channel. Gating is proposed to be initiated by an anticlockwise rotation of the N-terminal region of the C-linker, which is then, transmitted through the S6 transmembrane helices to the P-helix, and in turn from this to the pore lumen, which opens from 2 to 5 Å, thus allowing for ion permeation (Giorgetti et al. 2005). Defects produce channelopathies (Biel & Michalakis, 2007). A ring of four glutamate residues (Glu363) in the outer vestibule, and a ring of four threonines (Thr360) in the inner vestibule of the pore of CNGA1 channels constitute binding sites for permeating ions (Marchesi et al., 2012).  The tetraspanning peripherin-2 (TC# 8.A.40.1.2) links rhodopsin to this cyclic nucleotide-dependent channel in the outer 
segments of rod photoreceptors.  The G266D retinitis pigmentosa mutation
 in TMS 4 of rhodopsin abolishes binding of peripherin-2 and prevents 
association with the CNGA1/CNGB1a subunits present in the complex (Becirovic et al. 2014).  External protons cause inactivation (Marchesi et al. 2015). CNG transmembrane domains have dynamic structures, undergoing conformational rearrangements (Maity et al. 2015).  Moreover, structural heterogeneity of CNGA1 channels has been demonstrated (Maity et al. 2016). The structural basis of calmodulin (CaM) modulation of the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channel has been elucidated by cryoEM. CaM is a constitutive subunit of the rod channel that ensures high sensitivity in dim light (Barret et al. 2023)."	Animals

A short S4-S5 linker connects voltage-sensing and pore domains to produce a non-domain-swapped transmembrane architecture.

HCN1 exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions.  It's structure (3.5 Å resolution) is known (Lee and MacKinnon 2017).  It contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart and neurons. It may also mediate responses to sour stimuli. It is inhibited by Cs+, zatebradine, capsazepine and ZD7288 (Gill et al. 2004). HCN1 mutational variants include epileptic encephalopathy and common generalized epilepsy. HCN1 has a pivotal function in brain development and control of neuronal excitability (Marini et al. 2018). The interaction with filamin A seems to contribute to localizing HCN1 channels to specific neuronal areas and to modulating channel activity (Gravante et al. 2004). The HCN domain is required for HCN channel cell-surface expression, and it couples voltage- and cAMP-dependent gating mechanisms (Wang et al. 2020). Changes in the local S4 environment provide a voltage-sensing mechanism for mammalian hyperpolarization-activated HCN channels (Bell et al. 2004). Cation leak is an important pathogenic mechanism in HCN1-mediated developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), and seizures are exacerbated by sodium channel blockers in patients with HCN1 variants that cause cation leak (McKenzie et al. 2023).

These TOKs pass large currents only in the outward direction like this ScTOK. ScTOK, AfTOK1 (Aspergillus fumigatus), and H99TOK (Cryptococcus neoformans grubii) are K+-selective and pass current above the K+ reversal potential. CaTOK (Candida albicans) and CnTOK (Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans) pass both K+ and Na+ and conduct above a reversal potential, reflecting the mixed permeability of their selectivity filter. Mutations in CaTOK and ScTOK at sites homologous to those that open the internal gates in classical K+ channels are shown to produce inward TOK currents. Possibly the reversal potential determines ion occupancy, and thus, conductivity, of the selectivity filter gate that is coupled to an imperfectly restrictive internal gate, permitting the filter to sample ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane (Lewis et al. 2020).

in the chemoreception process in neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus where its pHi sensitivity
could be important in regulating excitability and therefore signalling of the O2/CO2 status.
Extracellular pH increases, brought about by HCO3- efflux from proximal tubule epithelial cells may couple to TASK-2 activation to maintain electrochemical gradients favourable to
HCO3- reabsorption. TASK-2 is expressed at the
basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells (López-Cayuqueo et al. 2014). Mutations are associated with the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) chronic tubulointerstitial renal disease (Reed et al. 2016). pH sensing in TASK2 channels is conferred by the combined action of several charged residues in the large extracellular M1-P1 loop (Morton et al. 2005). TASK-2, a member of the TALK subfamily of K2P channels, is opened by intracellular alkalization, leading the deprotonation of the K245 residue at the end of the TM4 helix. This charge neutralization of K245 may be sensitive or coupled to the fenestration state. The most important barrier for ion transport under K245+ and open fenestration conditions is the entrance of the ions into the channel (Bustos et al. 2020)."	Mammals

TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK are all regulated by lysophosphatidic acid, converting these  mechano-gated, pH voltage-sensitive channels into leak conductances (Chemin et al., 2005). The mammalian K2P2.1 potassium channel (TREK-1, KCNK2) is highly expressed in excitable tissues, where it plays a key role in the cellular mechanisms of neuroprotection, anaesthesia, pain perception and depression (Cohen et at., 2008).  Alternative translation initiation in rat brain yields K2P2.1 potassium channels permeable to sodium (Thomas et al. 2008). The crystal structure of the human 2-pore domain K+ channel, K2P1 has been solved (Miller and Long, 2012). Multiple modalities converge on a common gate to control K2P channel function (Bagriantsev et al., 2011).  TREK-1 mediates fast and slow glutamate release in astrocytes upon GPCR activation (Woo et al. 2012). It is a mechanosensitive K+ channel, present
in rat bladder myocytes, which is activated by swelling and arachidonic acid (Fukasaku et al. 2016). The M2-hinges of TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels control their macroscopic current, subcellular localization and gating (Zhuo et al. 2017). The human ortholog has acc # O95069 and has an additional N-terminal 15 aas. BL-1249, a compound from the fenamate class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is known to activate K2P2.1(TREK-1), the founding member of the thermo- and mechanosensitive TREK subfamily (Pope et al. 2018). Spadin and arachidonic acid, are known to suppress and activate TREK-1 channels, respectively (Pappa et al. 2020). Membrane phospholipids control gating of the mechanosensitive potassium leak channel, TREK1 (Schmidpeter et al. 2023). A photoswitchable inhibitor of TREK channels controls pain in wild-type intact freely moving animals (Landra-Willm et al. 2023). TREK-1 is an anesthetic-sensitive K+ channel (Spencer et al. 2023)."

Terbinafine is a selective activator of TASK3 (Wright et al. 2017). The response of the tandem pore potassium channel TASK-3 to voltage involves gating at the cytoplasmic

N-(2-((4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)amino)ethyl)benzamide (NPBA) is an activator (Tian et al. 2019).  KCC2 regulates neuronal excitability and hippocampal activity via interaction with Task-3 channels (Goutierre et al. 2019). A  biguanide compound, CHET3, is a highly selective allosteric activator, and TASK-3 is  a druggable target for treating pain (Liao et al. 2019). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019).

depolarization-induced secretion at least in part by maintaining 
intracellular K+ (Huang et al. 2011). TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium (TASK) channels, members of the two pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, are found in neurons, cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, where they are involved in the regulation of heart rate, pulmonary artery tone, sleep/wake cycles and responses to volatile anaesthetics (Rödström et al. 2020). K2P channels regulate the resting membrane potential, providing background K+ currents controlled by numerous physiological stimuli. Unlike other K2P channels, TASK channels are able to bind inhibitors with high affinity, exceptional selectivity and very slow compound washout rates. In general, potassium channels have an intramembrane vestibule with a selectivity filter situated above and a gate with four parallel helices located below, but the K2P channels studied so far all lack a lower gate. Rödström et al. 2020 presented the X-ray crystal structure of TASK-1, and showed that it contains a lower gate designated 'X-gate', created by interaction of the two crossed C-terminal M4 transmembrane helices at the vestibule entrance. This structure is formed by six residues ((243)VLRFMT(248)) that are essential for responses to volatile anaesthetics, neurotransmitters and G-protein-coupled receptors. Mutations within the X-gate and the surrounding regions affect both the channel-open probability and the activation of the channel by anaesthetics. Structures of TASK-1 bound to two high-affinity inhibitors showed that both compounds bind below the selectivity filter and are trapped in the vestibule by the X-gate, which explains their exceptionally low washout rates (Rödström et al. 2020). TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channel 2 promotes renal fibrosis by inducing cell-cycle arrest (Zhang et al. 2022)."	Animals
1.A.1.9.3	"Neuronal 2-P (4 TMS) domain K+ membrane tension-gated channel, TRAAK (stimulated by arachidonic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fink et al., 1998). The crystal structures of conductive and nonconductive human K2P TRAAK K+ channel has been solved (Brohawn et al., 2012; Brohawn et al. 2014). Regulated by mechanical deformation of the membrane and temperature as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids (Brohawn et al., 2012). Multiple modalities converge on a common gate to control K2P channel function (Bagriantsev et al., 2011).  In the non-conductive state, a lipid acyl chain accesses the channel 
cavity through a 5 Å-wide lateral opening in the membrane inner leaflet 
and physically blocks ion passage. In the conductive state, rotation of transmembrane helix 4 about a central hinge seals the intramembrane
 opening, preventing lipid block of the cavity and permitting ion entry.
 Additional rotation of a membrane interacting TM2-TM3 segment, unique 
to mechanosensitive K2Ps, against TM4 may further stabilize the 
conductive conformation. Comparison of the structures provodes a 
biophysical explanation for TRAAK mechanosensitivity--an expansion in 
cross-sectional area up to 2.7 nm2 in the conductive state is expected
 to create a membrane-tension-dependent energy difference between 
conformations that promotes force activation (Brohawn et al. 2014).  TM helix straightening and buckling may underlie channel activation (Lolicato et al. 2014). A lipid chain blocks the conducting path in the closed state (Rasmussen 2016)."	Animals
1.A.1.9.4	"Outward rectifying mechanosensitive 2-P (4 TMS) domain K+ channel, TREK-2 (KCNKA; KCNK10; K2P10). Activated by membrane stretch, acidic pH, arachidonic acid and unsaturated fatty acids.  Dong et al. 2015 described crystal structures of the human TREK-2 channel (up to 3.4 angstrom 
resolution) in two conformations and in complex with norfluoxetine, the 
active metabolite of fluoxetine (Prozac) and a state-dependent blocker 
of TREK channels. Norfluoxetine binds within intramembrane fenestrations
 found in only one of these two conformations. Channel activation by 
arachidonic acid and mechanical stretch involves conversion between 
these states through movement of the pore-lining helices. This 
provides an explanation for TREK channel mechanosensitivity, regulation 
by diverse stimuli, and possible off-target effects of the serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor Prozac (Dong et al. 2015).  The unique gating properties of TREK-2 and the mechanisms by which extracellular and intracellular stimuli harness pore gating
allosterically have been studied (Zhuo et al. 2016). TREK-2 moves from the ""down"" to the ""up"" conformation in direct response to membrane stretch. Aryal et al. 2017 showed how state-dependent interactions with lipids affect the movement of TREK-2, and how stretch influences both the inner pore and selectivity filter. They also demonstrated why direct pore block by lipid tails does not represent theprincipal mechanism of mechanogating (Aryal et al. 2017). The M2-hinges of TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels control their macroscopic current, subcellular localization and gating (Zhuo et al. 2017). TREK-2 responds to a diverse range of stimuli. Two states, ""up"" and ""down"", are known from x-ray structural crystallographic studies and have been suggested to differ in conductance. Brennecke and de Groot 2018 found that the down state is less conductive than the up state. The introduction of membrane stretch in the simulations shifts the state of the channel toward an up configuration. Membrane pressure changes the conformation of the transmembrane helices directly and consequently also influences the channel conductance (Brennecke and de Groot 2018). 3-d structures are known (PDB 4XDJ_!-D).

Such miracles led to Pope Urban IV to institut the feast of Corpus Christi in 1264. This followed celebration of a mass of Bolsena in 1263, led by a Bohemian priest who had doubts concerning transsubstantiation. 
 During the Mass, the eucharist appeared to bleed, and each time the

1.A.22.1.1	"Large mechanosensitive ion channel: MscL, with a subunit size of 136 aas with 2 TMSs; it catalyzes efflux of ions (slightly cation selective), osmolytes and small proteins. Residues in the putative primary gate are present in the first TMS (Levin and Blount 2004). Protein-lipid interactions are important for gating, dependent on TMS tilting (Iscla et al., 2011b).  The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic helices assemble into a pentameric bundle
that resembles cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and these are required for the selective formation of the pentamer (Ando et al. 2015). Lysophospholipids can increase the size of particles that can be transported (Foo et al. 2015). 500 - 700 channels are needed for 80% survival follwing a large changes in osmotic pressure, a number of channels similar to that found in wild type E. coli cells (Chure et al. 2018). its activation threshold decreases with membrane thickness; the membrane-thickness-dependent MscL opening mainly arises from structural changes in MscL to match the altered membrane thickness by stretching (Katsuta et al. 2018). MscL can provide a route for antibiotic entry into the E. coli cell, and agonists are available to facilitate their entry (Wray et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020). MscL has been used to design a synthetic mechanosensitive signaling pathway in compartmentalized artificial cells (Hindley et al. 2019). Available information at the ultrastructural level on lipids tightly bound to transport proteins and the impact of altered bulk membrane lipid composition has been reviewed (Stieger et al. 2021). Competition between hydrophobic mismatch and tension may result in opening tension for MscL (Wiggins and Phillips 2004)."	Bacteria

1.A.22.1.11	"Large conductance mechanosensitive channel protein, MscL, of 101 aas and 2 TMSs. When the membrane is stretched, MscL
responds to the increase of membrane tension and opens a nonselective pore to about 30 A wide,
exhibiting a large unitary conductance of approximately 3 nS. The structures of this archaeal MscL, trapped in the closed and expanded intermediate states, has been solved (Li et al. 2015). The comparative
analysis of these two new structures reveals significant conformational rearrangements in the
different domains of MscL. The large changes observed in the tilt angles of the two transmembrane
helices (TMS1 and TMS2) fit well with the helix-pivoting model. Meanwhile, the periplasmic loop region transforms from a
folded structure, containing an omega-shaped loop and a short beta-hairpin, to an extended and
partly disordered conformation during channel expansion. Moreover, a significant rotating and
sliding of the N-terminal helix (N-helix) is coupled to the tilting movements of TMS1 and TMS2. The
dynamic relationships between the N-helix and TMS1/TMS2 suggest that the N-helix serves as a membrane-anchored stopper that limits the tilts of TM1 and TM2 in the gating process (Li et al. 2015). Residues I21-T30 in TMS 1 constitute the hydrophobic gate, and the packing of aromatic rings of F23 in each subunit of Ma-MscL is critical to the hydrophobic gate (Zhang et al. 2021). Hydrophilic substitutions of the other functionally important residues, A22 and G26, modulate channel gating by attenuating the hydrophobicity of the  F23 constriction."

involved in plant development, including expression of light- and

involved in plant cell differentiation, organogenesis, somatic 
embryogenesis, cellular proliferation and plant growth. It is also involved in 
plant immunity, with antagonistic effects on bacterial and fungal 
resistances (Mosher et al. 2013).
CNGC17 and AHAs form a functional 
cation-translocating unit that is activated by PSKR1/BAK1 and possibly 
other BAK1/RLK complexes (Ladwig et al. 2015). PSKR is a transmembrane LRR-RLK family protein with a binding site for the small signalling peptide, phytosulfokine (PSK). There are 15 members in rice (Orysa sativa), induced under different conditions in different plant tissues  (Nagar et al. 2020). PSKR1 and PSYR1 mediate a signaling pathway in response to two
 distinct ligands, which redundantly contribute to cellular 
proliferation and plant growth (Amano et al. 2007)."	PSKR1 of Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)

1.A.23.2.1	"Major MscS channel protein, YggB. Seven residues, mostly hydrophobic, in the first and second transmembrane helices are lipid-sensing residues (Malcolm et al., 2011).  X-ray structures are available (Lai et al. 2013).  The cytoplasmic cage domain senses macromolecular crowding (Rowe et al. 2014). A gating mechanism has been proposed (Malcolm et al. 2015).  The thermodynamics of K+ leak have been studied (Koprowski et al. 2015).  In the
MscS crystal structure (PDB 2OAU ), a narrow, hydrophobic opening is visible in
the crystal structure, and a vapor lock, created by hydrophobic seals consisting of
L105 and L109, is the barrier to water and ions (Rasmussen et al. 2015). The voltage dependence of inactivation occurs
independently of the positive charges of R46, R54, and R74 (Nomura et al. 2016). The closed-to-open transition may involve rotation and tilt of the pore-lining helices (Edwards et al. 2005). A molecular dynamics study of gating has been published (Sotomayor and Schulten 2004).
 It suggested that when restraining the backbone of the protein, the 
channel remained in the open form and the simulation revealed 
intermittent permeation of water molecules through the channel. 
Abolishing the restraints under constant pressure conditions led to 
spontaneous closure of the transmembrane channel, whereas abolishing the
 restraints when surface tension (20 dyn/cm) was applied led to channel 
widening. The large balloon-shaped cytoplasmic domain of MscS exhibited 
spontaneous diffusion of ions through its side openings. Interaction 
between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain of MscS was 
observed and involved formation of salt bridges between residues Asp62 
and Arg128; this interaction may be essential for the gating of MscS. K+ and Cl- ions showed distinctively different distributions in and around the channel (Sotomayor and Schulten 2004)."	Protobacteria; homologues are found in archaea, yeast and plants.

It is 23% identical to MscCG (TC# 1.A.23.3.3) in the same organism. MscCG2-mediated L-glutamate excretion was activated by biotin limitation or penicillin treatment, and constitutive L-glutamate excretion was triggered by a gain-of-function mutation (A151V).

As the sole member of the Arabidopsis MSL family, localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, MSL1 is essential for maintaining the normal membrane potential of mitochondria. Li et al. 2020 reported a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of AtMSL1 at 3.3 Å. The overall architecture of AtMSL1 is similar to MscS, but the transmembrane domain of AtMSL1 is larger. Structural differences are observed in both the transmembrane and the matrix domain, and the carboxyl-terminus of AtMSL1 is more flexible while the beta-barrel structure observed in MscS is absent. The side portals in AtMSL1 are significantly smaller, and enlarging the size of the portal by mutagenesis can increase the channel conductance (Li et al. 2020).	Plants

The N-terminus of MSL10 (MSL10(N)) is an exemple of these IDRs. MSL10(N) adopted a predominately helical structure when exposed to the helix-inducing compound, trifluoroethanol (TFE), but in the presence of molecular crowding agents, MSL10(N) underwent structural changes and exhibited alterations to its homotypic interaction favorability. Collective behavior via in vitro imaging of condensates indicated that MSL8(N), MSL9(N), and MSL10(N) have sharply differing propensities for self-assembly into condensates, both inherently and in response to salt, temperature, and molecular crowding. These data establish the N-termini of MSL channels as IDRs with distinct biophysical properties and the potential to respond uniquely to changes in their physiochemical environments (Flynn et al. 2023).

Orthologues of MscA and MscB are present in most fungi, including plant and animal pathogens. MscA/MscB and other fungal MscS-like proteins share the three TMSs and the extended C-terminal cytosolic domain that form the structural fingerprint of MscS-like channels (Dionysopoulou et al. 2022).

1.A.23.4.3	"Mechanosensative cation-selective channel with a conductance of 100 pS, YnaI (344aas; 4 - 6 TMSs).  Protects against hypoosmotic shock (Edwards et al. 2012).  The structure has been solved by cryo-electron microscopy to a
resolution of 13 Å (Böttcher et al. 2015). While the cytosolic vestibule is structurally similar to that in MscS,
additional density is seen in the transmembrane region, consistent with the presence of two
additional TMSs predicted for YnaI. The location of this density suggests that the extra TMSs are tilted, which could induce local membrane curvature extending the tension-sensing
paddles seen in MscS. Off-center lipid-accessible cavities are seen that resemble gaps between the
sensor paddles in MscS. The conservation of the tapered shape and the cavities in YnaI suggest a
mechanism similar to that of MscS (Böttcher et al. 2015). The voltage dependence of inactivation occurs
independently of the positive charges of R46, R54, and R74 (Nomura et al. 2016). A 3.8 Å structure by cryoEM revealed a heptamer structural fold similar to previously studied MscS channels. The ion-selective filter is formed by seven hydrophobic methionines (Met158) in the transmembrane pore (Yu et al. 2017). Details of the gating transition for MscS have been predicted (Zhu et al. 2018). YnaI has a gating mechanism based on flexible pore helices (Flegler et al. 2020), and thus, MscS-like channels of different sizes have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and fine-tuned conductive properties. Attempted Cryo-EM structural determination of detergent-free YnaI Using SMA2000 revealed limitations of this method (Catalano et al. 2021)."	Proteobacteria

It functions as do the bacterial homologues, but is essential for leaf growth, chloroplast integrity and normal starch accumulation (Jensen and Haswell 2012).  msl2 msl3 double mutant seedlings exhibit several hallmarks of drought or 
environmental osmotic stress, including solute accumulation, elevated 
levels of the compatible osmolyte proline (Pro), and accumulation of the
 stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, msl2 msl3 mutants 
expressed Pro and ABA metabolism genes in a pattern normally seen under 
drought or osmotic stress. Pro accumulation in the msl2 msl3 mutant was 
suppressed by conditions that reduce plastid osmotic stress leading to the conclusion that these channels function like their bacterial homologues (Wilson et al. 2014)."	Plant

1.A.23.4.7	"Mechanosensitive ion channel protein 8 (Mechanosensitive channel of small conductance-like 8) (MscS-like protein 8, Msl8) is
 a pollen-specific, membrane tension-gated ion channel required for 
pollen to survive the hypoosmotic shock of rehydration and for full male
 fertility. It negatively regulates pollen germination but is required for cellular integrity during germination and tube growth. MSL8 thus senses and responds to changes in membrane tension associated with pollen hydration and germination (Hamilton et al. 2015).  Mechanosensitive ion channels, MSL8, MSL9, and MSL10, have environmentally sensitive intrinsically disordered regions with distinct biophysical characteristics (Flynn et al. 2023).  Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are highly dynamic sequences that rapidly sample a collection of conformations over time. In the past several decades, IDRs have emerged as major components of many proteomes, comprising ~30% of all eukaryotic protein sequences. Proteins with IDRs function in a wide range of biological pathways and are notably enriched in signaling cascades that respond to environmental stresses. Flynn et al. 2023 identified and characterized intrinsic disorder in the soluble cytoplasmic N-terminal domains of MSL8, MSL9, and MSL10, three members of the MscS-like (MSL) family of mechanosensitive ion channels. In plants, MSL channels are proposed to mediate cell and organelle osmotic homeostasis. See TC# 1.A.23.4.14 for details of MSL10."	Plants

2.A.85.2.1	An inorganic anion (Cl-/NO3-) transporter, ALMT12 or QUAC1 (Quickly activating Anion Channel 1), reported to be incapable of transporting organic anions, is involved in stomatal closure (Sasaki et al, 2010). It is an R-type inorganic anion channel required for stomatal movement in Arabidopsis guard cells (Meyer et al., 2010).  The C-terminal cytosolic domain mediates voltage gating (Mumm et al. 2013). QUAC1 regulates stomatal closure in response to environmental stimuli (Qin et al. 2022). See Dabravolski and Isayenkov 2023 for a review of the ALMT subfamiily.	Plants

2.A.85.2.3	"The root aluminum-activated malate efflux transporter, ALMT1 (required for aluminum tolerance) (Hoekenga et al., 2006).  Also called Quick Anion Channel, QUAC, based on activation kinetics of anion channel currents in response to voltage changes.  Evolutionary studies have been reported (Dreyer et al. 2012).  Plants respond to aluminum (Al) ions by releasing malate from their root
apices via ALMT1 with malate bound to the toxic Al ions, contributing
to Al tolerance (Sasaki et al. 2014). ALMT1 mediates the efflux of malate to chelate the Al3+ in acidic soils and underlies the plant's Al resistance. Wang et al. 2021 presented cryo-EM structures of AtALMT1 in the apo, malate-bound, and Al-bound states at up to 3.0 Å resolution. The AtALMT1 dimer assembles an anion channel, and each subunit contains six transmembrane helices (TMSs) as well as six cytosolic α-helices. Two pairs of Arg residues are located in the center of the channel pore and contribute to malate recognition. Al binds at the extracellular side of AtALMT1 and induces conformational changes of the TMS 1-2 loop and the TMS 5-6 loop, resulting in the opening of the extracellular gate (Wang et al. 2021). Qin et al. 2022 provided insight into the gating and modulation of the ALMT12/QUAC1 anion channel in Glycine max (soybean). Picrotoxin inhibits anion flux but not GABA flux (Ramesh et al. 2022)."

May also transport a variety of organic and inorganic anions (Piñeros et al. 2008). It can also transport GABA (Ramesh et al. 2018). ALMT1 has 6 TMSs with the N- and C-termini being on the external surface of the plasma membrane (Motoda et al. 2007).	Plants

TMSs 1 - 6 occur together near the N-terminus; putatives TMS 7 is near the middle of the protein, and putative TMS 8 is near the C-terminus. Citrate is an open channel blocker.  There are probably four subunits, and TMS5 contributes to pore formation (Zhang et al. 2013). It has higher selectivity for malate than for fumarate and exhibits weak chloride conductance (Kovermann et al. 2007). The apple ALMT9 requires a conserved C-terminal domain for malate transport, underlying fruit acidity (Li et al. 2020)."	Plants

rejection or some forms of autoimmune disease. Can insert into the 
membrane of target cells in its calcium-bound form, oligomerize and form
 large pores (Law et al. 2010). Promotes cytolysis and apoptosis of target cells by 
facilitating the uptake of cytotoxic granzymes. Perforin gene mutations contribute to hereditary cancer predisposition (Chaudhry et al. 2016). After perforin is secreted by CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and disrupts the membranes of extracellular vesicles (EVs), adenosine is released from the EVs and acts as an immunosuppressive metabolite by binding to the adenosine receptor on the CTL membrane. This mechanism provides a novel survival strategy using cancer cell-derived EVs (Tadokoro et al. 2020)."	Perforin of Homo sapiens

1.C.39.3.3	"Complement component C6 of 934 aas and 1 TMS; targets phagocytic and some non phagocytic cells (McCormack et al. 2013).  Expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal tissue-forming cells. It is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles, derived from 
multiple organelles that translocate to and fuse with 
bacterium-containing vesicles.
Subsequently, perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 Å 
pores in the bacterial surface
with perforin-2 cleavage products present in the bacteria. Perforin-2 is
 also required for the
bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as well as
 hydrolytic enzymes (McCormack et al. 2015).
 Perforin-2 exists in membrane-bound (P2a) and secretory (P2b) isoforms,
 both present in human macrophages. P2a promotes fusion of vesicles with
 lysosomes, and may therefore play important roles in immune defense  (Xiong et al. 2017).
 Loss of MPEG1 causes increased susceptibility to microbial infection. 
MPEG1 expression is upregulated in response to proinflammatory signals 
such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS). Furthermore, germline mutations in MPEG1 have been identified in 
connection with recurrent pulmonary mycobacterial infections. Structural
 studies on MPEG1 revealed that it can form oligomeric pre-pores and 
pores. The unusual domain arrangement within the MPEG1 architecture 
suggests a novel mechanism of pore formation that may have evolved to 
guard against unwanted lysis of host cells (Bayly-Jones et al. 2020)."	Animals

It consists of two structurally distinct domains, a MACPF domain and a previously uncharacterized type of domain. GNIP1Aa is unique in being a prokaryotic MACPF member to have both its structure and function identified. It is specifically toxic to Diabrotica virgifera virgifera larvae upon feeding. The MACPF domain is probably important for oligomerization and transmembrane pore formation, while the accompanying domain may define the specificity of the target of toxicity. In GNIP1Aa the accompanying C-terminal domain has a unique fold composed of three pseudosymmetric subdomains with shared sequence similarity, a feature not obvious from the initial sequence examination. This domain is in a family named beta-tripod. Important regions in the beta-tripod domain, which may be involved in target recognition, have been identified (Zaitseva et al. 2019).

GRP78 consists of two major functional domains: the ATPase and protein/peptide-binding domains. The protein/peptide-binding domain of cell-surface GRP78 has served as a novel functional receptor for delivering cytotoxic agents (e.g., a apoptosis-inducing peptide or taxol) across the cell membrane. The ATPase domain of GRP78 (GRP78ATPase) has potential as a transmembrane delivery system of cytotoxic agents including nucleotides (e.g., ATP-based nucleotide triphosphate analogs) (Hughes et al. 2016). It may also play a role in facilitating the assembly 
of multimeric protein complexes inside the ER (Evensen et al. 2013). 
It is involved in the correct folding of proteins and degradation of misfolded
 proteins via its interaction with DNAJC10, probably to facilitate the 
release of DNAJC10 from its substrate (Evensen et al. 2013). Grp78 as a critical factor in Kras-mutated adenomagenesis. This can be attributed to a critical role for Grp78 in GLUT1 expression and localization, targeting glycolysis and the Warburg effect (Spaan et al. 2023).

2.A.55.2.1	Divalent heavy metal (Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Pb2+) ion:H+ symporter, Nramp2 or divalent metal transporter, DMT1 = SLC11A2 (Garrick et al. 2003). A 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini is established. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TMSs 1-5 and TMSs 6-10 (conserved Slc11 hydrophobic core) is suggested (Czachorowski et al., 2009).  A conserved motif in a central flexible region of TMS1 (DPGN) binds the metal ion (Wang et al. 2011).  It is upregulated by iron deficiency and downregulated by iron loading (Nam et al. 2013).  NRAMP2 also serves as the Sindbis alpha virus receptor (Rose et al. 2011).  DMT1 interacts with the iron chaparone protein, PCBP2 (Q15366), in an iron-dependent fashion, and may be essential for iron uptake (Lane and Richardson 2014). Mutations cause a syndrome of congenital microcytic hypochromic anemia, poorly responsive to oral iron treatment, with liver iron overload associated paradoxically with normal to moderately elevated serum ferritin levels (Beaumont et al. 2006). Nigral iron accumulation and activation of NMDA receptors contribute to the neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease, and activation of NMDA receptors participates in iron metabolism in the hippocampus (Xu et al. 2018). NMDA receptor inhibitors MK-801 and AP5 protect nigrostriatal projection systems and reduce nigral iron levels. NMDA treatment increased the expression of DMT1 and decreased the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) (TC# 2.A.100.1.4) (Xu et al. 2018). DMT1 cannot be a direct donor of catalytic copper because it does not have the cytosol domain present in Ctr1, which is required for copper transfer to the Cu-chaperons that assist the formation of cuproenzymes (Ilyechova et al. 2019).  Slc11a2 activity is essential for intestinal non-heme iron absorption after birth, and is also required for normal hemoglobin production during the development of erythroid precursors (Gunshin et al. 2005). May also take artemisinin (Girardi et al. 2020). Optimal conditions for Western blotting for this and other proteins requires that the sample not be boiled (Tsuji 2020). DMT1 polymorphisms affect blood lead levels of occupationally exposed individuals (Mani et al. 2021). Obese mice show defects in DMT1 function and thus iron deficiency (Zhang et al. 2024).	Animals

2.A.55.2.18	"NRAMP4 of 512 aas and 12 TMSs, a vacuolar metal transporter involved in

 and cadmium (Cd), and regulates metal accumulation under Fe starvation. It acts redundantly with NRAMP3 (which is 85% identical to it) to mobilize vacuolar Fe and provide 
sufficient Fe during seed germination (Lanquar et al. 2005). In association with NRAMP3, 
it is required for optimal growth and photosynthesis under Mn deficiency. It exports Mn from vacuoles in leaf mesophyll cells, making Mn available 
for functional photosystem II in chloroplasts (Lanquar et al. 2010). Its ortholog in Thlaspi japonicum has been characterized (Mizuno et al. 2005). Expression of particular transmembrane transporters (e.g., members of 
the ZIP (ZNT1) and NRAMP (NRAMP4) families) leads to metal tolerance and
 accumulation in plants (Fasani et al. 2021)."	NRAMP4 of Arabidopsis thaliana

2.A.55.2.2	Me2+ (Fe2+, Cd2+, Co2+):H+ symporter, DCT1 (Nramp2) (Splice variant isoforms serve different functions).   The stoichiometry between metal ion and proton in the symport process catalyzed by DCT1 varies under different conditions due to mechanistic proton slip.  A single reciprocal mutation, I144F, in TMS2 of DCT1 abolished the metal ion transport activity, increased the slip currents, and generated sodium slip currents (Nevo, 2007).  A double mutation, adding F227I in TMS4 to I144F restored the uptake activity of DCT1 and reduced the slip currents. Thus, these regions are important in coupling metal ion and proton symport (Nevo, 2007).   NRAMP2 also serves as the Sindbis alpha virus receptor (Rose et al. 2011).  Three isoforms are expressed differentially in different cell types and are developmentally regulated (Ding et al. 2013).

This protein is 52% identical to TC# 2.A.55.2.8 throughout its length, and is therefore probably orthologous to this Arabidopsis protein.	NRAMP metal ion transporter of Camellia sinensis (tea)
2.A.55.2.23	Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein, MsNRAMP of 554 aas and 12 TMSs.  Chesapeake Bay striped bass (Morone saxatilis) is experiencing an epizootic of mycobacteriosis that threatens the health of this species. Burge et al. 2004 characterized an Nramp gene in this species and show that induction follows Mycobacterium exposure. MsNramp contains all the signal features of the Nramp family, including a topology of 12 transmembrane domains (TM), the transport protein-specific binding-protein-dependent transport system inner membrane component signature, three N-linked glycosylation sites between TMSs 7 and 8, sites of casein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation in the amino and carboxy termini, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site between TMSs 6 and 7. MsNramp was present in all tissues assayed. Within 1 day of injection of Mycobacterium marinum, MsNramp expression was highly induced (17-fold higher) in peritoneal exudate (PE) cells (Burge et al. 2004).	MsNRAMP of Morone saxatilis

2.A.55.2.3	Macrophage and intestinal divalent cation (Mn2+ > Fe2+):H+ antiporter (catalyzes divalent cation efflux and regulates cation homeostasis), NRAMP1, scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI) or Slc11a2.  (Techau et al., 2007). The C-terminal cytoplasmic PDZ-interacting domain and the C-terminal transmembrane domains are both necessary for HDL signaling. Direct binding of cholesterol to the C-terminal transmembrane domain has been demonstrated (Assanasen et al. 2005). Thus, HDL signaling requires cholesterol binding and efflux as well as the C-terminal domains of SR-BI; thus, SR-BI serves as a cholesterol sensor on the plasma membrane. The G212V mutation leads to microcytic anemia and liver iron overload (Bardou-Jacquet et al., 2011). Multiple targeting motifs direct NRAMP1 into lysosomes (Cheng and Wang, 2012). The structure and topology has been studied revealing a symmetric but inversely oriented arrangement (Li et al., 2012). Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the caprine and bovine orthologs led to mechanistic predictions (Triantaphyllopoulos et al. 2019). Leishmania infection triggers hepcidin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Nramp1 to increase phagolysosomal iron availability (Banerjee and Datta 2020). It may also transport, or play a role in transport, of α- and β-carotene as well as cyptoxanthine, lutein, lycopene (Reboul 2013).	Animals
2.A.55.2.4	"The major root plasma membrane high affinity Me2+(Fe2+, Co2+. Mn2+, Cd2+) uptake transporter, NRAMP-1 (also called NRAMP1 and NRAMP-6) is stimulated by Mn2+ deficiency) (Cailliatte et al., 2010).  In silico analyses of plant NRAMPs have been performed  using NRAMP1 as the query sequence (Vatansever et al. 2016). Cd2+ stress induces Ca2+ signals in Arabidopsis roots. The calcium-dependent protein kinases, CPK21 
and CPK23, interact with the Cd transporter, NRAMP6/NRAMP1, through a 
variety of protein interactions. CPK21/23 phosphorylate NRAMP6 primarily at Ser489 and Thr505 to inhibit 
the Cd2+ transport activity of NRAMP6, thereby improving the Cd tolerance 
of plants (Zhang et al. 2022). Two calcineurin B-like proteins, CBL1/9, and their interacting kinase 
CIPK23, positively regulate the tolerance of Mn toxicity in Arabidopsis.
 The cbl1 cbl9 double mutant and cipk23 mutants exhibited 
high-Mn-sensitive phenotypes, which manifested as decreased primary root
 length, biomass, and chlorophyll concentration, as well as higher accumulation
 of Mn. In addition, CIPK23 interacted with and phosphorylated the Mn 
transporter NRAMP1 primarily at Ser20/22, and 
thereby induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NRAMP1 to reduce its 
distribution in the plasma membrane and enhance plant tolerance to Mn 
toxicity. Hence, the CBL1/9-CIPK23-NRAMP1 module 
regulates the tolerance to high-Mn toxicity and provides insight into a 
mechanism of tolerance of plants to Mn toxicity (Zhang et al. 2023)."	Plants

secretin oligomer adopts a heterogeneous architecture with 16- and

assembly of the needle complex and form the central ""cup"" substructure of this secretion system. The ortholog of SpaQ in E. coli (SctS, of 86 aas and 2 TMSs like SpaQ) functions to ensures the fittings between the dynamic and static components of the T3SS (Tseytin et al. 2019). The Salmonella flagellar protein export machinery consists of a transmembrane export gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. The gate complex has two intrinsic and distinct H+-driven and Na+-driven engines to drive the export of flagellar structural proteins (Minamino et al. 2021). Salmonella wild-type cells preferentially use the H+-driven engine under a variety of environmental conditions. The Na+-driven engine is activated by the interaction of the FlgN chaperone with FlhA when the ATPase complex is non-functional due to either of two single-residue substitutions in FlhA. Thus, it is likely that the FlgN-FlhA interaction generates a conformational change in FlhA that allows it to function as a Na+ channel. Minamino et al. 2021 proposed that this type of activation would be useful for flagellar construction under conditions in which the proton motive force is severely restricted. In enteropathogenic E. coli, assembly of the T3SS is initiated by the association of three proteins, SctR, SctS, and SctT, which create an entry portal to the translocation channel within the bacterial inner membrane. Using the T3SS, Tseytin et al. 2022 investigated the role of two structural construction sites formed within the SctRST complex that are likely to act as seals, preventing leakage of ions and metabolites rather than as substrate gates. Two residues in SctS, Pro23, and Lys54, are critical for the proper activity of the T3SS. Pro23 may be critical for the physical orientation of the SctS transmembrane domains that create the tip of the SctRST complex and for their positioning with regard to other T3SS substructures. SctS Lys54, which was previously suggested to mediate the SctS self-oligomerization, is critical for T3SS activity due to its essential role in SctS-SctT hetero-interactions (Tseytin et al. 2022).

The electron/proton-transfer pathway in the anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio gigas involves a homo-dimer, each protomer comprising two hydrophilic subunits, A and B, and one transmembrane subunit C, together with six redox cofactors including two b-hemes. One menaquinone molecule is bound near heme bL in the hydrophobic subunit C. This location of the menaquinone-binding site differs from the menaquinol-binding cavity proposed previously for QFR from Wolinella succinogenes (TC#3.D.10.1.3). The bound menaquinone may serve as an additional redox cofactor to mediate the proton-coupled electron transport across the membrane.

The 3 kDa SdhF forms a single transmembrane helix, and this helix plays a role in blocking the canonically proximal quinone-binding site. The authors also identified two distal quinone-binding sites with bound quinones. One distal binding site is formed by neighboring subunits of the complex, and the electron/proton transfer pathway for succinate oxidation by menaquinone was revealed. The structure provides insight into the physiological significance of a trimeric respiratory complex II. The structure of the menaquinone binding site could provide a framework for the development of Sdh-selective anti-mycobacterial drugs (Gong et al. 2020). The architecture of SdhABC (type F), with a membrane-embedded Rieske FeS cluster, has been solved to 2.5 Å resolution (Zhou et al. 2021). A quinone-binding site and a rarely observed Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, the latter being embedded in the transmembrane region, were identified, and an electron transfer pathway that connects the substrate-binding and quinone-binding sites was identified (Zhou et al. 2021).

2.A.22.1.1	"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5 HT):Na+:Cl- symporter, SERT-A  It also transports amphetamines; blocked by cocaine and tricyclic antidepressants such as Prozac; interacts directly with the secretory carrier-associated membrane protein-2 (SCAMP2; O15127) to regulate the subcellular distribution (Muller et al., 2006). The 3 D structure is known ()PDB 5I6X), and it uses an alternating sites mechanism with all 3 substrates bound (Zhang and Rudnick, 2006).  Molecular determinants for antidepressants in the human serotonin and norepinephrine A transporters have been identified (Andersen et al., 2011). A conserved asparagine residue in transmembrane segment 1 (TMS1) of the serotonin transporter dictates chloride-coupled neurotransmitter transport (Henry et al., 2011). The formation and breakage of ionic interactions with amino acids in transmembrane helices 6 and 8 and intracellular loop 1 may be of importance for substrate translocation (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). Methylation of the SLC6A4 gene promoter controls depression in men by an epigenetic mechanism (Devlin et al., 2010).  The 5HT Km is 0.4 micromolar (Banovic et al. 2010).  Regulated allosterically by ATM7 which stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of SERT (Kortagere et al. 2013).  Functional and regulatory mechanisms involving the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains have been considered (Fenollar-Ferrer et al. 2014).  The range of substrates bound and transported has been predicted (Kaufmann et al. 2009).  TMS3 may function in substrate and antagonist recognition (Walline et al. 2008).  The 3-d x-ray structures with antidepressants bound have been solved, leading to mechanistic predictions; antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between TMSs 1,
3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding (Coleman et al. 2016).  Na+ and cocaine stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT
and decrease phosphorylation while agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, ibogaine)
increase phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors, cocaine and ibogaine, were each
reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na+ and stimulation
by ibogaine occurred at concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening,
respectively (Zhang et al. 2016).  SERT is regulated by multiple molecular
mechanisms including its physical interaction with intracellular proteins including the ASCT2 (alanine-serine-cysteine-threonine 2; TC# 2.A.23.3.2), co-expressed with SERT in serotonergic neurons and involved in the
transport of small neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane (Seyer et al. 2016).  SERT transports substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) (Sealover et al. 2016).  A naturally occurring mutation, I425V,
associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders, activates hSERT
and eliminates stimulation via the cyclicGMP-dependent pathway (Zhang et al. 2007).  The substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 
ecstasy), is a widely used drug of abuse that induces non-exocytotic 
release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine through their cognate
 transporters as well as blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitter by 
the same transporters. In SERT, Glu394 plays a role in MDMA recognition (Sealover et al. 2016). Intestinal dysbiosis may upregulate SERT expression and contribute to the development of chronic constipation (Cao et al. 2017). Cryo-EM structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations have been solved (Coleman et al. 2019). Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMSs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TMS 1a and the partial unwinding of TMS 5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm, thus defining the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations. SERT and cholecytokinin (CCK) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of Irrritable Bowl Syndrome (IBS-D) by regulating the brain-gut axis and affecting visceral sensitivity (Qin et al. 2020). Altered SERT function leads to several neurological diseases including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) (Szöllősi and Stockner 2021). The structure and dynamics of the two sodium binding sites indicate that sodium binding is accompanied by an induced-fit mechanism that leads to new conformations (Szöllősi and Stockner 2021). Occlusion of the  serotonin transporter is mediated by serotonin-induced conformational changes in the bundle domain (Gradisch et al. 2022). A structural rearrangement of the SERT intracellular gate is induced by Thr276 phosphorylation (Chan et al. 2022). Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters form oligomers. A leucine heptad repeat in TMS2 and a glycophorin-like motif in TMS6 may stabilize the oligomer (Just et al. 2004). Oligomerization of hSERT involves at least two discontinuous interfaces to form an array-like structure containing multimers of dimers (Just et al. 2004). Degenerative mitral valve (MV) regurgitation (MR) is a highly prevalent 
heart disease that requires surgery in severe cases. A
 decrease in the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) 
accelerates MV remodeling and progression to MR; decreased serotonin transporter activity in the mitral valve contributes to progression of degenerative mitral regurgitation (Castillero et al. 2023). Cocaine-regulated trafficking of dopamine transporters in cultured neurons has been revealed using a pH sensitive reporter (Saenz et al. 2023). Two SERT ligands, fluoxetine and escitalopram, enter neurons within minutes, while simultaneously accumulating in many membranes (Nichols et al. 2023). Berberine and evodiamine influence serotonin transporter (5-HTT) expression via the 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (Hu et al. 2012). Dehydroevodiamine has a dihedral angle of 3.71 degrees  compared to 82.34 degrees  for evodiamine. Dehydroevodiamine can more easily pass through a phospholipid bilayer than evodiamine because it has a more planar stereo-structure (Luo et al. 2023).  SLC6A4 gene variants moderate associations between childhood food insecurity and adolescent mental health (Pilkay et al. 2024)."

2.A.22.1.2	Noradrenaline (norepinephrine):Na+ symporter (NET1, NAT1, SLC6A2) (also transports 1-methyl-4-tetrahydropyridinium and amphetamines; it is a target of cocaine and amphetamines as well as of therapetics for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  This homooligomeric transporter binds one substrate molecule per transporter subunit (Schwartz et al., 2005; Schlessinger et al., 2011; Andersen et al., 2011). Extracellular loop 3 contributes to substrate and inhibitor selectivity (Lynagh et al. 2013). The highly conserved MELAL and GQXXRXG motifs, located in the second transmembrane domain and the first intracellular loop of hNET, respectively, are determinants of NET cell surface expression, and substrate and inhibitor binding (Sucic and Bryan-Lluka 2007). Based on modeling, the high affinity substrate binding site (S1) of the human norepinephrine transporter has been predicted and then verified by mutational studies (Jha et al. 2020). Proline residues play roles in the expression and function of the human noradrenaline transporter (Paczkowski and Bryan-Lluka 2004). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) facilitates norepinephrine transporter dimerization and modulates substrate efflux (Luethi et al. 2022).	Animals
2.A.22.1.3	"Dopamine:Na+  symporter, DAT (also takes up amphetamines in symport with Na+  which promotes intracellular Na+-dependent dopamine efflux (Khoshbouei et al., 2003)). It is inhibited by cocaine, amphetamines, neurotoxins, antidepressants and ethanol (Chen et al., 2004)]. Zn2+  potentiates uncoupled Cl- conductance (Meinild et al., 2004).  A conserved salt bridge between TMSs 1 and 10 constitutes an extracellular gate (Pedersen et al. 2014). The 3-D structure of DAT is known (PDB 4M48; 4XPA).  P101 of DAT plays an essential role in DA translocation (Lin and Uhl 2005). DAT is regulated by D3 dopamine receptors (Zapata et al., 2007). P25α (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein, TPPP (UniProt acc # O94811) increases dopamine transporter localization to the plasma membrane (Fjorback et al., 2011). DAT mediates paraquat (an herbicide) neurotoxicity (Rappold et al., 2011).  Membrane cholesterol modulates the outward facing conformation and alters cocaine binding (Hong and Amara 2010).  Threonine-53 phosphorylation  in the rat orthologue (P23977) (Serine 53 in the human transporter) regulates substrate reuptake and amphetamine-stimulated efflux (Foster et al. 2012).  DAT is enriched in filopodia and induces filopodia formation (Caltagarone et al. 2015).  Dasotraline is an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, used for the treatment of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Hopkins et al. 2015). When in complex with 1-(1-benzofuran-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine (5-MAPB), a psychoactive adictive agonists, DAT can
exhibit conformational transitions that spontaneously isomerize the transporter into the inward-facing
state, similarly to that observed in dopamine-bound DAT (Sahai et al. 2016).  The cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains contribute to substrate and inhibitor binding (Sweeney et al. 2016). DAT can exist as a monomer, a cooperative dimer subject to allosteric regulation (Cheng et al. 2017) or an oligomer involving the scaffold domain but not the bundle domain (Jayaraman et al. 2018). Cocaine binds in the S1 site to stabilize an inactive form of DAT (Krout et al. 2017). Dopamine efflux is caused by 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) (Shekar et al. 2017). The cholesterol binding sites observed in the DAT crystal structures may be preserved in all human monoamine transporters (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine) and when cholesterol is bound, transport is inhibited (Zeppelin et al. 2018).  The cell permeable furopyrimidine, AIM-100, augments DAT oligomerization through an allosteric mechanism associated with the DAT conformational state, and oligomerization-triggered clustering leads to a coat-independent endocytosis and subsequent endosomal retention of DAT (Sorkina et al. 2018). Dysfunction of this transporter leads to disease states, such as Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder and/or depression (Jayaraman et al. 2018). DAT dysfunction is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The DAT Val559 mutation changes the transporter localization and lateral mobility that contributes to ADE and alterations in dopamine signaling underlying multiple neuropsychiatric disorders (Thal et al. 2018). A  tight spatial and functional relationship between the DAT/GLT-1 
transporters and the Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channel immediately readjusts 
the membrane potential of the neuron, probably to limit the 
neurotransmitter-mediated neuronal depolarization (Bartolomé-Martín et al. 2019). Evidence for the association of polymorphisms of DAT1 (SLC6A3) with heroin dependence has been presented (Koijam et al. 2020). A direct coupling between conformational dynamics of DAT, functional activity of the transporter and its oligomerization leading to endocytosis has been documented (Sorkina et al. 2021). Association of the sigma-1 receptor with the dopamine transporter attenuates the binding of methamphetamine via helix-helix interactions (Xu and Chen 2021). Potential partners for DAT, include the transmembrane chaperone 4F2hc (TC# 8.A.9.2.2), the proteolipid M6a (TC# 9.B.38.1.1) and a potential membrane receptor for progesterone (PGRMC2) (TC# 9.B.433.1.1) (Piniella et al. 2021). Two cytoplasmic proteins: a component of the Cullin1-dependent ubiquitination machinery termed F-box/LRR-repeat protein 2 (FBXL2; Q9UKC9), and the enzyme inositol 5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2; O15357) were also associated. M6a, SHIP2 and Cullin1 were shown to increase DAT activity in coexpression experiments. M6a, enriched in neuronal protrusions (filopodia or dendritic spines), colocalized with DAT in these structures. In addition, the product of SHIP2 enzymatic activity (phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2]) was tightly associated with DAT. PI(3,4)P2 strongly stimulated transport activity in electrophysiological recordings, and conversely, inhibition of SHIP2 reduced DA uptake (Piniella et al. 2021). There are weak associations between DAT mRNA expression and DAT availability in human brains (Pak et al. 2022). Gender differences in cocaine-induced hyperactivity and dopamine transporter trafficking to the plasma membrane have been reported (Deng et al. 2022). The dopamine transporter and synaptic vesicle sorting defects underlie auxilin-associated Parkinson's disease (Vidyadhara et al. 2023). DAT may play a role in Parkinson's disease (Zhou et al. 2023). Dopamine transporter (DAT) deficient rodents have been characterized suggesting perspectives and limitations for neuroscience (Savchenko et al. 2023). Epigenetic analyses of the dopamine transporter gene DAT1 through methylation have reveaed the basis for certain personality traits in athletes (Humińska-Lisowska et al. 2023). Interactions of calmodulin kinase II with the 
dopamine transporter facilitate cocaine-induced enhancement of evoked 
dopamine release (Keighron et al. 2023). Known data on the consequences of changes in DAT expression in experimental animals, and results of pharmacological studies in these animals have been reviewed (Savchenko et al. 2023). DAT knockout rats display epigenetic alterations in response to cocaine exposure, and targeting epigenetic modulators, Lysine Demethylase 6B (KDM6B) and Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)may be therapeutic in treating addiction-related behaviors in a sex-dependent manner (Vilca et al. 2023).  An overview of patient preparation, common imaging findings, and

8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing

prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix

The STAS domain has been solved by x-ray crystalography (PDB# 3LLO).  Functions to remove and recycle synaptic glycine from inhibitory synapses.  Mutations in GlyT are a common cause of hyperakplexia or startle disease in humans. The ER chaparone, calnexin, facilitates GlyT processing (Arribas-González et al. 2013). An allosteric binding site on GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics has been identified (Mostyn et al. 2019), and it is formed by a crevice between TMSs 5, 7, and 8, and extracellular loop 4. Membrane cholesterol binds to and modulates the function of various SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters, including stabilizing the outward-facing conformation of the dopamine and serotonin transporters. Frangos et al. 2023 investigated how cholesterol binds to GlyT2 (SLC6A5), modulates the glycine transport rate, and influences bioactive lipid inhibition of GlyT2.

The stoichiometry of Na+:Cl-:amino acid = 3:1:1 (Le Guellec et al. 2022).  SLC6A14 depends on heat shock protein HSP90 for trafficking to the cell surface (Rogala-Koziarska et al. 2019). It is upregulated in some forms of cancer; residues important for function have been identified (Palazzolo et al. 2019). Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulates the ATB(0,+) transporter for arginine and neutral amino acids in human airway epithelial cells (Barilli et al. 2021). Reshaping the binding pocket selectively reduces access for cationic aas and derivatives (Anderson et al. 2022). Machine learning identified SLC6A14 as a

A dominant hyperekplexia (startle disease) mutation Y705C in humans alters trafficking and the biochemical properties of GlyT2 (Gimenez et al. 2012). Structural determinants of the neuronal glycine transporter 2 for the selective inhibitors ALX1393 and ORG25543 have been determined (Benito-Muñoz et al. 2021).  The efficacy of the analgesic GlyT2 inhibitor, ORG25543, is determined by two connected allosteric sites (Chater et al. 2023).

Cooperative Binding of Substrate and Ions Drives Forward Cycling of the Human CT-1. Creatine deficiency disorders have been reviewed (PMID 20301745). Transport of creatine metabolic precursors have also been discussed (Jomura et al. 2022), and the use of SLC6A8 for theraputic purposes has been considered (Kurth et al. 2021). The CreaT2 gene is expressed exclusively in the testes, but CreaT1 is expressed in a variety of tissues (Snow and Murphy 2001). CT1 is present in mouse kidney, skeletal muscle and brown adiose tissue, but not in the pancreas, and levels are suject to organ-specific regulation (Lygate et al. 2022).  Variants in GAMT, GATM and SLC6A8 for cerebral creatine deficiency syndromeshave been identified (Goldstein et al. 2024).

2.A.22.3.2	"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA):Na+:Cl- symporter, GAT-1 (Stoichiometry, GABA:Na+ = 1:2 where both Na+ binding sites, Na1 and Na2, have been identified.  Na2 but not Na1 can accommodate Li+ (Zhou et al., 2006)). Cai et al. 2005 have reported that N-glycosylation increases the stability, trafficking and GABA-uptake of GABA transporter 1. Glutamine 291 is essential for Cl- binding (Ben-Yona et al., 2011). Four human isoforms have been identified, GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and GAT-4, all about 70% identical to each other (Borden et al., 1992).  GAT-2 transports γ-aminobutyric acid and β-alanine (Christiansen et al, 2007) It also concentratively takes up β-alanine and α-fluoro-β-alanine (Liu et al., 1999). GAT1 is capable of intracellular Na+-, Cl-- and GABA-induced outward currents (reverse GABA transport; GABA efflux) (Bertram et al., 2011). An acidic amino acid residue in transmembrane helix 10 conserved in the Neurotransmitter:Sodium:Symporters is essential for the formation of the extracellular gate of GAT-1 (Ben-Yona and Kanner, 2012). It is required for stringent gating and tight coupling of ion- and substrate-fluxes in the GABA transporter family (Dayan et al. 2017). GAT-1 is the target of the antiepileptic drug, tiagabine (Kardos et al. 2010). The monomeric protein has been purified fused to GFP (Hu et al. 2017). The methodology involving the reconstitution of GABA, glycine and glutamate transporters has been described (Danbolt et al. 2021). Neurodevelopmental phenotypes have been associated with pathogenic variants of SLC6A1 (Kahen et al. 2021). 4-Phenylbutyrate restores GABA uptake and reduced seizures in SLC6A1 patient variants (Nwosu et al. 2022). The cryo-EM structure of full-length, wild-type human GAT1 in complex with its clinically used inhibitor, tiagabine, has appeared (Motiwala et al. 2022). Inhibition of GAT1 prolongs the GABAergic signaling at the synapse and 
is a strategy to treat certain forms of epilepsy. Nayak et al. 2023 presented the cryoEM structure of Rattus norvegicus GABA transporter 1 (rGAT1) at a resolution of 3.1 Å. The structure revealed rGAT1 in a 
cytosol-facing conformation, with a linear density in the primary 
binding site that accommodates a molecule of GABA, a displaced ion 
density proximal to Na site 1 and a bound chloride ion. A unique 
insertion in TM10 aids the formation of a compact, closed extracellular 
gate (Nayak et al. 2023). The molecular basis for substrate recognition and transport by human GABA transporter GAT1 has been determined (Zhu et al. 2023). These investigators reported four cryogenicEM structures of human GAT1 at 
resolutions of 2.2–3.2 Å. GAT1 in substrate-free form or in complex with
 the antiepileptic drug tiagabine exhibits an inward-open conformation. 
In the presence of GABA or nipecotic acid, inward-occluded structures 
are captured. The GABA-bound structure reveals an interaction network 
bridged by hydrogen bonds and ion coordination for GABA recognition. The
 substrate-free structure unwinds the last helical turn of transmembrane
 helix TM1a to release sodium ions and substrate (Zhu et al. 2023) who have identified associations between the 3D structure and variant pathogenicity, variant functions, and phenotypes in SLC6A1-related disorders."	Animals

Regulation of the cellular content of taurine in mammalian cells has been reviewed (Lambert 2004). Biallelic mutation of the TauT-encoding gene is linked to early retinal degeneration (Preising et al. 2019). Oral taurine administration of retinal degeneration and cardiomyopathy reverses the phenotype (Ansar et al. 2019). Overexpression of SLC6A6 suppresses neointimal formation by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (Rong et al. 2023).	Animals

expression was selectively decreased in the central amygdala of 
alcohol-dependent people as well. Thus, impaired GABA clearance within the amygdala contributes to alcohol

2.A.22.4.1	High affinity tryptophan:Na+ symporter, TnaT, of 501 aas and 12 TMSs (Androutsellis-Theotokis et al., 2003). The Km for Tryptophan is 145 nM; tryptamine and serotonin weakly inhibited with Ki values of 200 and 440 μM, respectively. An evolutionarily conserved role of adjacent transmembrane segments 7 and 8 has been proposed (Kniazeff et al. 2005).	Bacteria
2.A.22.4.2	"The amino acid (leucine):2 Na+ symporter, LeuTAa (Yamashita et al., 2005). LeuT possesses two ion binding sites, NA1 and NA2, both highly specific for Na+ but with differing mechanisms of binding (Noskov and Roux, 2008). X-ray structures have been determined for LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states (Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012).  Extracytoplasmic substrate binding at an allosteric site controls activity (Zhao et al. 2011).  It has been proposed that the 5 TMS repeat derived from a DedA domain (9.B.27; Khafizov et al. 2010).  Mechanistic aspect of Na+ binding have been studied (Perez and Ziegler 2013).  Structural studies of mutant LeuT proteins suggest how antidepressants bind to biogenic amine transporters (Wang et al. 2013).  The detailed mechanism was studied by Zhao and Noskov, 2013.  Uptake involves movement of the substrate amino acid from the outward facing binding site, S1, to the inward facing binding site, S2, coupled with confrmational changes in the protein (Cheng and Bahar 2013).  The complete substrate translocation pathway has been proposed (Cheng and Bahar 2014). The inward facing conformation of LeuT has been solved (Grouleff et al. 2015).  Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gatemay determinethe catalytic efficiency of the transporter (Billesbølle et al. 2015). Of the two Na+ binding sites, occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations
presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8 whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions (Tavoulari et al. 2015). TMS1A movements revealed a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred
from the crystal structure, especiallly with respect to the inner vestibule (Sohail et al. 2016). Partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1, 5, 6 and7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state (Merkle et al. 2018). A conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site is required for substrate binding to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains (Zhang et al. 2018). The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has revealed the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020). This involves a major tilting of the cytoplasmic end of TMS5, which, together with release of the N-terminus but without coupled movement of TM1) opens a wide cavity towards the second Na+ binding site. The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has been solved, revealing the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020)."	Bacteria

 The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the 
partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved 
GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water 
to access the Na+2 site. Solvation through this TMS 5 pathway may 
facilitate Na+ release from the Na+2 site to the inward-open state (Malinauskaite et al. 2014). TMS5 plays a role in the binding and release of Na+ from the Na+2 site and in mediating conformational changes (Stolzenberg et al. 2017). MhsT of Bacillus halodurans is a transporter of hydrophobic amino acids and a homologue of the eukaryotic SLC6 family of Na+ -dependent symporters for amino acids, neurotransmitters, osmolytes, and creatine.

2.A.22.6.3	"B(O)AT1 or BOAT (SLC6A19; Hartnup's disease protein) is a kidney and intestinal apical membrane epithelial transporter for Na+-dependent, Cl--independent reabsorption of neutral amino acids.  Many neutral L-amino acids bind with  ~0.5 mM affinities; Leu is the preferred substrate, but all
 large, neutral, non-aromatic, L-amino acids bind to this transporter. 
Uptake of leucine is sodium-dependent. In contrast to other members of 
the neurotransmitter transporter family, this one does not appear to be 
chloride-dependent.  Activity is enhanced by collectrin (Tmem27), a collecting duct transmembrane (1 TMS) glycoprotein (Q9HBJ8) (Danilczyk et al., 2006). The mouse orthologue is (Q9D687) (Broer et al., 2004; 2008) which is deficient due to mutation(s) in its structural gene, and it forms a complex with collectrin and the brush border carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Q9BYF1). Mutations in Hartnup disorder protein, such as B0AT1(R240Q), decrease complex formation (Kraut and Sachs 2005) and lead to neutral aminoaciduria and in some cases pellagra-like symptoms (Kowalczuk et al., 2008; Singer et al. 2012).  Collectrin is expressed at high levels in the simple
embryonic kidney (the pronephros) of amphibians such as Xenopus  (McCoy et al. 2008). ACE2 plays an important role in amino acid transport by
 acting as a binding partner of SLC6A19 in  the
intestine, regulating its trafficking, expression on the cell surface and catalytic activity (Kowalczuk et al. 2008, Camargo et al. 2009). ACE2 is also the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( causitive agent of COVID-19). Yan et al. 2020 presented cryoEM 
structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of B0AT1 with or without the receptor 
binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of 
SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms. The ACE2-B0AT1
 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the 
collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is 
recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through 
polar residues (Yan et al. 2020)."	Animals

2.A.64.1.1	TatABCE translocase. Early contacts between substrate proteins and TatA have been demonstrated (Fröbel et al., 2011). TatC helix 5 and the TatB transmembrane helix interact (Kneuper et al., 2012).  TatC functions as an obligate oligomer (Cleon et al. 2015). TatA is the most abundant component of the complex and facilitates assembly of this complex.It exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane, but forms linear clusters upon increased expression of TatBC (Smith et al. 2017).  TatA and TatB both have the capacity to bind at two TatC sites, one in TMS5 and one in TMS6 (Habersetzer et al. 2017). However in vivo this is regulated according to the activation state of the complex. In the resting-state system, TatB binds the polar cluster site in TMS 5 with TatA occupying the site in TMS 6. However, when the system is activated by overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch binding sites. Habersetzer et al. 2017 proposed that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase. A  highly conserved glutamate residue in the transmembrane region of E. coli TatC, which, when modified by DCCD, interferes with the deep insertion of a Tat signal peptide into the TatBC receptor complex (Blümmel et al. 2017). Different from TatA but rather like TatB, TatE contacts a Tat signal peptide independently of the proton-motive force and restricts the premature processing of a Tat signal peptide (Eimer et al. 2018). Furthermore, TatE embarks at the transmembrane helix five of TatC where it becomes so closely spaced to TatB that both proteins can be covalently linked by a zero-space cross-linker. This suggests that in addition to TatB and TatC, TatE is a component of the Tat substrate receptor complex. A bioinformatic analysis revealed a relatively broad distribution of tatE genes in bacterial phyla and highlights unique protein sequence features of TatE orthologs (Eimer et al. 2018). A TatA/TatB binding site on the TatC component of the E. coli Tat tanslocase has been identified (Severi et al. 2023).	Proteobacteria (also present in archaea and eukaryotic organelles)

It catalyzes Pi:Na+ = 1:2 iselectrogenically. Upon Pi limitation in the medium, TgPiT is more abundant at the plasma membrane. ΔTgPiT parasites accumulate 4-times more acidocalcisomes, storage organelles for phosphate, and exhibit many traits that differ from the wild type organims including poor virulence (Asady et al. 2020).

Mapping of the minimal transporting unit suggested a structure universal to all PiT-related proteins (Battger and Pedersen, 2011).The protein can transport Pi in the absence of Na+, and mutations allow Na+ transport in the absence of Pi. Transmembrane amino acids E(55) and E(575) appear to be responsible for linking Pi import to Na+symport (Bøttger et al. 2006). SLC20A2 variants cause the loss of Pi transport activity in mammalian cells (Sekine et al. 2019). Mutation of SLC20A2 seems to cause hereditary multiple exostoses (Li et al. 2020).

2.A.69.1.1	"Auxin efflux carrier, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) (Reinhardt et al., 2003; Carraro et al. 2012). Catalyzes auxin efflux without the participation of any other protein (Petrasek et al., 2006).  PIN1 determines the direction of
intercellular auxin flow (Wang et al. 2014). It consists of two TMS bundles, each of 5 TMSs at the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the protein (Nodzyński et al. 2016), confirming previous bioinformatic predictions (Mansour et al. 2007). Arabidopsis VASCULATURE COMPLEXITY AND CONNECTIVITY (VCC) (TC# 8.A.175) is a plant-specific transmembrane protein that controls the development of veins in cotyledons. Yanagisawa et al. 2021 showed that the expression and localization of PIN1 is altered in vcc developing cotyledons, and that overexpression of PIN1-GFP partially rescues vascular defects of vcc mutants. Genetic analyses suggested that VCC and PINOID (PID), a kinase that regulates PIN1 polarity, are both required for PIN1-mediated control of vasculature development. VCC expression is upregulated by auxin, likely as part of a positive feedback loop for the progression of vascular development. VCC and PIN1 localized to the plasma membrane in pre-procambial cells but were actively redirected to vacuoles in procambial cells for degradation. In the vcc mutant, PIN1 failed to properly polarize in pre-procambial cells during the formation of basal strands, and instead, it was prematurely degraded in vacuoles. VCC plays a role in the localization and stability of PIN1, which is crucial for the transition of pre-procambial cells into procambial cells that are involved in the formation of basal lateral strands in embryonic cotyledons (Yanagisawa et al. 2021). Three inward-facing conformational structures of Arabidopsis thaliana PIN1: the apo state, bound to the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and in complex with the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) have been solved (Yang et al. 2022). The transmembrane domain of PIN1 shares a conserved NhaA fold. In the substrate-bound structure, IAA is coordinated by both hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen bonding. NPA competes with IAA for the same site in an intracellular pocket, but with a much higher affinity (Yang et al. 2022). PIN-FORMED is required for shoot phototropism/gravitropism and facilitates meristem formation in Marchantia polymorpha (Fisher et al. 2023). Phytopathogens causes worldwide crop losses. Parmagnani et al. 2023 showed that microbial volatile organic compound (mVOC; 1-nonanol and 1-dodecanol) profile of Erwinia amylovora, enhances A. thaliana shoot and root growth. E. amylovora mVOCs triggered early signaling events including plasma transmembrane potential Vm depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations, K+-gated channel activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) bursts from a few minutes to 16 h upon exposure. These early events were followed by the modulation of the expression of genes involved in plant growth and defense responses as well as responses to phytohormones, including abscisic acid, gibberellin, and auxin (including via the efflux carriers PIN1 and PIN3). A unique mutation in PIN-FORMED1 and a genetic pathway for reduced sensitivity of Arabidopsis roots to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid have been identified (Huang et al. 2023)."	Plants

Cryo-EM structures of AtPIN3 in the apo state and in complex with its substrate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) at 2.6-3.0 Å resolution have been determined (Su et al. 2022). AtPIN3 exists as a homodimer, with TMSs 1, 2, and 7 in the scaffold domain involved in dimerization. The dimeric AtPIN3 forms a large, joint extracellular-facing cavity at the dimer interface while each subunit adopts an inward-facing conformation. The structural basis for the recognition of IAA and NPA were revealed and elucidated the molecular mechanism of NPA inhibition. The AtPIN3 structures support an elevator-like model for the transport of auxin, whereby the transport domains undergo up-down rigid-body motions and the dimerized scaffold domains remain static (Su et al. 2022). CslPIN3 is involved in the regulation of root growth and development as well as auxin accumulation in tea plants (Hu et al. 2023).	Plants

3.A.3.1.1	"Na+-, K+-ATPase (Na+ efflux; K+ uptake).  Kinetic alterations due to a missense mutation in the alpha2 subunit cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (Segall et al. 2004). Mutation in the γ-subunit causes renal hypomagnesemia, associated with hypocalciurea (Cairo et al., 2008). The Na/K-ATPase is an important signal transducer that not only interacts and regulates protein kinases, but also functions as a scaffold (Li and Xie, 2009). Capsazepine, a synthetic vanilloid, converts the Na, K-ATPase to a Na-ATPase (Mahmmoud, 2008a). There are alternative α- and β-subunits, α1, α2,... β1, β2,... in muscle which form α1β1, α1β2, α2β1 and α2β2, heterodimers, each with differing Na+ affinities (4-13mM) (Kristensen and Juel, 2010). α3 and β3 isoforms have also been identified. The γ-subunit is the same as TC# 1.A.27.2.1. Poulsen et al. (2010) have proposed a second ion conduction pathway in the C-terminal part of the ATPase. The two C-terminal tyrosines stabilize the occluded Na/K pump conformations containing Na or K ions (Vedovato and Gadsby, 2010). Na+, K+-ATPase mutations causing familial hemiplegic migraines type 2 (FHM2) inhibit phosphorylation (Schack et al., 2012). Salt, the vascular Na+/K+ ATPase and the endogenous glycosides, ouabain and marinobufagenin, play roles in systemic hypertension (Hauck and Frishman, 2012). Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of Ser936 (in the intracellular loop between
transmembrane segments M8 and M9) opens an intracellular C-terminal water pathway leading to the third Na+-binding site (Poulsen et al., 2012). PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates activity in vivo. Ser-938 is located (Einholm et al. 2016). E960 on the Na+-K+-ATPase and F28 on phospholemman (PLM) are critical for phospholemman (PLM) inhibition, but there is at least one additional site that is important for tethering PLM to the ATPase. Mutations in the Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit gene (ATP1A3) cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden onset of dystonic spasms and slow movements (Doğanli et al. 2013).  The 3-d strcuture of the Na+-bound Na+,K+-ATPase at 4.3 Å resolution reveals the positions of the three Na+ ions (Nyblom et al. 2013).  Mutations cause adrenal hypertension (Kopec et al. 2014) as well as alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) and rapid-onset dystonia-
parkinsonism (RDP) (Rosewich et al. 2014).  Differences in the structures of the ouabain-, digonxin- and bufalin-bound enzyme have been reported (Laursen et al. 2015).  ATPase inhibitors have been shown to be effective anti-cancer agents (Alevizopoulos et al. 2014). Cys45 in the β-subunit can be glutathionylated, regulating the activity of the enzyme (Garcia et al. 2015). ATP1A2 mutations play a role in migraine headaches (Friedrich et al. 2016). The beta2 subunit is
essential for motor physiology in mammals, and in contrast to beta1 and beta3, beta2
stabilizes the Na+-occluded E1P state relative to the outward-open E2P state (Hilbers et al. 2016). Numerous transcription factors, hormones, growth factors, lipids, and 
extracellular stimuli as well as epigenetic signals modulate the transcription of Na,K-ATPase 
subunits (Li and Langhans 2015). Čechová et al. 2016 have identified two cytoplasmic pathways along the pairs of TMSs, TMS3/TMS7 or TM6S/TMS9 that allow hydration of the cation binding sites or transport of cations from/to the bulk medium. Dissipation of the transmembrane gradient of K+ and Na+ due to ouabain inhibition increases Ptgs2 and Nr4a1 transcription by increasing Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels that, in turn, leads to CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of CREB and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT, respectively (Smolyaninova et al. 2017). ZMay play a role in the development of gastric adenocarcinomas (Wang et al. 2017). Mutations F785L and T618M give rise to familial rapid onset dystonia parkonsonism by distinct mechanisms (Rodacker et al. 2006). Reacts with methylglyoxal to inhibit its activity (Svrckova et al. 2017).  Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by reduction of Na,K-ATPase functional activity. Petrushanko et al. 2016 showed that monomeric Abeta(1-42) forms a tight (Kd of 3 mμM), enthalpy-driven equimolar complex with alpha1beta1 Na,K-ATPase. Complex formation results in dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme hydrolytic activity. The binding site of Abeta(1-42) is localized in the ""gap"" between the α- and β-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, disrupting the enzyme functionality by preventing the subunits from shifting towards each other. Interaction of Na,K-ATPase with exogenous Abeta(1-42) leads to a pronounced decrease of the enzyme transport and hydrolytic activities and Src-kinase activation in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. This interaction allows regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by short-term increases in the Abeta(1-42) level (Petrushanko et al. 2016). Two distinct phospholipids bind to two distinct sites on the ATPase, affecting activity and stability (Habeck et al. 2017). Five cysteinyl residues (C452, C456, C457, C577, and C656) serve as the cisplatin binding sites on the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices 4 and 5 (Šeflová et al. 2018). Mutations can cause F/SHM with moderate penitrance (Prontera et al. 2018).  Arginine substitution of a cysteine in transmembrane helix M8 converts the Na+,K+-ATPase to an electroneutral pump similar to the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (Holm et al. 2017). Early onset life-threatening epilepsy can be associated with ATP1A3 gene variants (Ishihara et al. 2019), and loss of Na/K pump function is the common feature of mutants that induce hyperaldosteronism (Meyer et al. 2019). Three Na+ sites are defined in the Na+-bound crystal structure of the Na+, K+-ATPase. Sites I and II overlap with two K+ sites in the K+-bound structure, whereas site III is unique and Na+ specific. A glutamine in transmembrane helix M8 (Q925) appears from the crystal structures to coordinate Na+ at site III, but does not contribute to K+ coordination at sites I and II. Nielsen et al. 2019 addressed the functional role of Q925 in the various conformational states of this-ATPase by examining the mutants Q925A/G/E/N/L/I/Y both enzymatically and electrophysiologically, thereby revealing their Na+ and K+ binding properties. Q925 substitutions had minor effects on Na+ binding from the intracellular side of the membrane, but mutations Q925A and Q925G increased the apparent Na+ affinity, but caused dramatic reductions of the binding of K+ as well as Na+ from the extracellular side of the membrane. Thus, an interaction between sites III and I and a possible gating function of Q925 in the release of Na+ at the extracellular side are supported (Nielsen et al. 2019). The alpha2 Na+/K+-ATPase isoform mediates LPS-induced neuroinflammation (Leite et al. 2020). Apical periodontitis induces changes on oxidative stress parameters and increases Na+/K+-ATPase activity in adult rats (Barcelos et al. 2020). Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 can be due to a missense mutation (L425H) in ATP1A2 (Antonaci et al. 2021). Mutations in ATP1A3 and FXYD genes (TC# 1.A.27) can cause childhood-onset schizophrenia (Chaumette et al. 2020). The ATPase plays a role in cell adhesion, motility, and migration of cancer cells (Silva et al. 2021). TMS2 moves outward as Na+ is deoccluded from the E1 conformation (Young and Artigas 2021). Kinetic properties and crystal structures of the Na+,K+-ATPase in complex with cardiotonic steroids (CTS) has revealed differences between CTS subfamilies. Ladefoged et al. 2021 found beneficial effects of K+ on bufadienolide binding in contrast to the well-known antagonism between K+ and cardenolides. Bufadienolide binding is affected by (i) electrostatic attraction of the lactone ring by a cation and (ii) the ability of a cation to stabilize and ""shape"" the site constituted by transmembrane helices of the alpha-subunit (αM1-6). The latter effect was due to varying coordination patterns involving amino acid residues from helix bundles αM1-4 and αM5-10. Substituents on the steroid core of a bufadienolide add to and modify the cation effects (Ladefoged et al. 2021). The Na+-K+-ATPase functions in the developing hippocampus (Shao et al. 2021). CryoEM analyses of the Na+,K+-ATPase in the two E2P states with and without cardiotonic steroids has revealed mechanistic details (Kanai et al. 2022). A conserved ion-binding site tyrosine plays a role in ion selectivity of the Na+/K+ pump (Spontarelli et al. 2022). Essential roles of the Na+K+-ATPase in ischemic pathology provide a platform for the improvement in clinical research on ischemic stroke (Zhu et al. 2022). In intact live cells, the regulatory complex is composed of two alpha subunits associated with two beta subunits, decorated with two PLM regulatory subunits. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generated a structural model of the complex. alpha-alpha subunit interactions support conformational coupling of the catalytic subunits, which may enhance the NKA turnover rate (Seflova et al. 2022). There is a phenotypic continuum of ATP1A3-related disorders (Vezyroglou et al. 2022). The Na+/K+-ATPase is central to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases such as alternating hemiplegia of childhood. This ATPase has 3 distinct ion binding sites I-III. Binding of Na+ at each site in the human alpha3 Na+/K+-ATPase can be resolved using extracellular Na+-mediated transient currents. When the ATPase is constrained to bind and release only Na+, three kinetic components: fast, medium, and slow, can be isolated, depending on the voltage step direction and the occlusion (or deocclusion) of each of the 3 Na+s. Patient-derived mutations of residues which coordinate Na+ at site III exclusively impact the slow component, demonstrating that site III is crucial for deocclusion and release of the first Na+ into the extracellular milieu (Moreno et al. 2022). The opening of ion channels in cardiomyocytes is regulated by the surface electric double layer of the cell membrane as revealed by studies with digoxin (Zhou et al. 2022). The effects of H2O2 on cys residues and other targets in the Na,K-ATPase have been discussed (Chkadua et al. 2022). The influence of the Na+/K+-ATPase on neurodegenerative diseases has been reviewed (Zhang et al. 2022). The presence of two oppositely directed transmembrane ion gradients (for Na+ and K+) is important for robust stabilization of cellular volume in human erythrocytes (Ataullakhanov et al. 2022).  This ATPase plays important roles in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang et al. 2022). Na/K-ATPase signaling tonically inhibits sodium reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule (Mukherji et al. 2023). Hypoxic stress-dependent regulation of Na,K-ATPase in ischemic heart disease has been reviewed (Baloglu 2023).  Chronic testosterone deficiency increases late inward sodium current and promotes triggered activity in ventricular myocytes from aging male mice (Banga et al. 2023). Three dynamic lipid interaction sites in the plasma membrane Na+,K+-ATPase influence activity of the transporter (Mahato and Andersson 2023). Interaction of pumps and transporters positioned at distant biological 
membranes with various forms of energy transfer between them may result in hypoxic/reperfusion injury, different kinds of muscle fatigue,
 and nerve-glia interactions (Dimitrov 2023). Marinobufagenin (MBG) is a member of the bufadienolide family of 
compounds, which are natural cardiac glycosides found in a variety of 
animal species, including man, which have different physiological and 
biochemical functions but have a common action on the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase. MBG acts
 as an endogenous cardiotonic steroid, and in the last decade, its role 
as a pathogenic factor in various human diseases has emerged (Carullo et al. 2023).  A malfunctioning gene product is required for disease induction by ATP1A1 variants and that if a pathology is associated with protein-null variants, they may display low penetrance or high age of onset (Spontarelli et al. 2023). The Na,K-ATPase is a murzyme, facilitating thermodynamic equilibriums at the membrane-interface (Manoj et al. 2023).  The Na+K+-ATPase is present in boar sperm HPM, and it changes during capacitation (Awda et al. 2023). Clinical features of CAPOS syndrome are caused by maternal ATP1A3 gene variation (Gao et al. 2024).Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), governs the degradation of Na+/K+-ATPase via an autoinhibitory domain of PI3K p85α (Jin et al. 2024).  Two lysines in the transmembrane segments contribute to generate a pump with reduced stoichiometry (2 K+/1 Na+), allowing Artemia to maintain steeper Na+ gradients in hypersaline environments (Artigas et al. 2023)."

This non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase (ATP12A) is expressed in mammalian spermatozoa (Favia et al. 2022) and may be sodium ion sensitive (Abe et al. 2023). Its cryoEM structures are known, and the mechanism has been explained (Abe et al. 2023), providing insight into the molecular mechanism of the E2-E1 transition and cooperative Na+-binding in the NKA and other related cation pumps.

3.A.3.10.19	"Mn2+-exporting ATPase, ATP13A1 of 1204 aas.  Defects cause Mn2+-dependent neurological disorders.  Orthologous to the yeast Mn2+-ATPase, Spf1 (Cohen et al. 2013). It is present in the endoplasmic reticulum while the other P5 ATPases, A2 - A5, are in overlapping compartments of the endosomal system (Sørensen et al. 2018). It complements the yeast ER ATPase, SPF1 (TC#3.A.3.10.3) although ATP13A2 - 5 do not, and unlike these latter proteins, it seems to have 12 (rather than 10) TMSs, with the two extra ones in an N-terminal domain (Sørensen et al. 2018).  ATP13A1 (Spf1 in yeast) directly interacts with the TMSs of mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins (McKenna et al. 2020). P5A-ATPase mediates the extraction of mistargeted proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cryo-electron microscopy structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spf1 (TC# 3.A.3.10.3) revealed a large, membrane-accessible substrate-binding pocket that alternately faced the ER lumen and cytosol and an endogenous substrate resembling an alpha-helical TMS. Thus, the P5A-ATPase can dislocate misinserted hydrophobic helices flanked by short basic segments from the ER. TMS dislocation by the P5A-ATPase establishes an additional class of P-type ATPase substrates and may correct mistakes in protein targeting or topogenesis (McKenna et al. 2020). It has been designated as a transmembrane islocase (Dederer and Lemberg 2021). It was initially thought to mediate manganese transport (Cohen et al. 2013). However,
 it was later shown to specifically bind moderately hydrophobic TMSs with short hydrophilic lumenal domains that misinsert into
 the endoplasmic reticulum (McKenna et al. 2020). The P5A-ATPase extracts mistargeted or mis-inserted TMSs from the ER membrane for protein quality control, while the P5B-ATPases mediate export of polyamines from late endo-/lysosomes into the cytosol (Sim and Park 2023). ATP13A1 prevents ERAD of folding-competent mislocalized and misoriented proteins (McKenna et al. 2022). Thus, the P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 prevents the accumulation of mislocalized and misoriented proteins, which are eliminated by different ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways in mammalian cells. Without ATP13A1, mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins mislocalize to the ER through the ER membrane protein complex and are cleaved by signal peptide peptidase for ERAD. ATP13A1 also facilitates the topogenesis of a subset of proteins with an N-terminal TMS or a signal sequence that should insert into the ER membrane with a cytosolic N terminus. Without ATP13A1, such proteins accumulate in the wrong orientation and are targeted for ERAD by distinct ubiquitin ligases. Thus, ATP13A1 prevents ERAD of diverse proteins capable of proper folding (McKenna et al. 2022)."	Animals

This protein as well as ATP13A2 has been implicated in Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorder (Sørensen et al. 2018). ATPA2 - 5 are all in compartments of the endosomal system and all have 10 TMSs with overlapping functions, often in different amounts in different tissues (Sørensen et al. 2018). Dysregulation of polyamine homeostasis strongly associates with human 
diseases. ATP13A2 is mutated in juvenile-onset Parkinson's

Deletion of the gene results in ER stress and lowered Mn2+ in the ER lumen (Cohen et al. 2013). This SPF1-ATPase is a transmembrane helix dislocase, used to remove some mislocated TM proteins from the outer membranes of mitochondria (McKenna et al. 2020). Spf1p exhibits unique structures at its N-terminus, including two putative additional transmembrane domains, and a large insertion connecting the P domain with transmembrane segment M5 (Petrovich et al. 2021). The Spf1p P5A-ATPase ""arm-like"" domain is not essential for ATP hydrolysis but its deletion impairs autophosphorylation (Grenon et al. 2021). Structures of this dismutase and Msp1 reveal how they remove mislocalized TA proteins from the ER and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively (Sinning and McDowell 2022). ATP hydrolytic activity of purified Spf1p correlates with micellar lipid fluidity and is dependent on conserved residues in transmembrane helix M1. Free movement of the M1 helix represent an energetic constraint on catalysis, and this constraint is likely lost in the purified preparations, resulting in protein with intrinsic spontaneous ATP hydrolytic activity. Removal of the N-terminal part of the protein apparently removes this activity (Ipsen and Sørensen 2022). Inhibition of P5A-ATPases such as Spf1p could potentiate metal ion-induced ER stress and proteotoxicity (Petrovich et al. 2022)."	Fungi

3.A.3.10.7	"This protein, ATP13A2 or P5A ATPase or ATP13A(1), was orginally designated the functionally uncharacterized P-type ATPase, FUPA13 (Thever and Saier 2009).  It is the Parkinson''s disease (PD) gene product, PARK9 (ATP13A2), and its defect gives rise to multiple abnormalities (Dehay et al. 2012).  It is similar to the incorrectly assigned manganese exporter in yeast, Ypk1 (TC# 3.A.3.10.8), and may have the same function, but in  lysosomes, it is a polyamine (spermine/spermidine) exporter (van Veen et al. 2020). Toxic levels of manganese or abnormal levels of polyamines may cause a syndrome simiilar to PD (Chesi et al. 2012).  Manganese homeostasis in the nervous system has been reviewed (Chen et al. 2015).  The progression of PD may involve the
lysosome and different autophagy pathways (Gan-Or et al. 2015).  It exhibits an activity-independent scaffolding role in trafficking/export of intracellular cargo in response to proteotoxic stress (Demirsoy et al. 2017). Mutations cause rare early onset Parkinson's disease (Suleiman et al. 2018). ATP13A2 modulates astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus bringing to light a direct link between astrocyte lysosomes and neuroinflammation in the pathological model of PD (Qiao et al. 2016). ATP13A2 and its close homologs, collectively known as P5B-ATPases, are polyamine transporters in endo-/lysosomes. Cryo-EM structures of human ATP13A2 in five distinct conformational 
intermediates, which together, represent a near-complete transport cycle
 of ATP13A2, have been determined. The structural basis of the polyamine specificity was 
revealed by an endogenous polyamine molecule bound to a narrow, 
elongated cavity within the transmembrane domain. The structures show an
 atypical transport path for a water-soluble substrate, in which 
polyamines may exit within the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane (Sim et al. 2021). Spermine is exported from the lysosome. The transmembrane domain
 serves as a substrate binding site, and the C-terminal domain is 
essential for protein stability and may play a regulatory role (Chen et al. 2021). The carcinogenic effects of ATP13A2 in different tumors has been studied (Zheng and Li 2021). High-resolution cryo-EM structures of human ATP13A2 in five distinct conformational intermediates have been determined, which together, represent a near-complete transport cycle of ATP13A2. The structural basis of the polyamine specificity was revealed by an endogenous polyamine molecule bound to a narrow, elongated cavity within the transmembrane domain. The structures show an atypical transport path for a water-soluble substrate, in which polyamines may exit within the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane (Sim et al. 2021). Mutations in ATP13A2 aare associated with mixed neurological presentations and iron toxicity due to nonsense-mediated decay (Kırımtay et al. 2021). The importance of the protein in regulating neuronal integrity has been established, and the structural dynamics and catalytic mechanism have been proposed (Mateeva et al. 2021). It is an ATPase which acts as a lysosomal polyamine exporter with high affinity for spermine, and also stimulates cellular uptake of polyamines and protects against polyamine toxicity (van Veen et al. 2020; Sim and Park 2023). Dysregulation of polyamine homeostasis strongly associates with human 
diseases. ATP13A2 is mutated in juvenile-onset Parkinson's

3.A.3.10.8	This protein, P5B-ATPase, was originally designated the functionally uncharacterized P-type ATPase 14 (FUPA14) (Thever and Saier 2009), but it has been shown to be a vacuolar ATPase, Ypk1, that functions in manganese detoxification and homeostasis (Chesi et al. 2012).  It is therefore likely to catalyze export of manganese ions from the cytoplasm into the vacuole. However, it also transporter polyamines such as spermine . The 3-D structure has been determined to 3.4 Å, and it revealed three separate transport cycle intermediates, including spermine-bound conformations (Li et al. 2021). In the absence of cargo, Ypk9 rests in a phosphorylated conformation auto-inhibited by the N-terminus.

3.A.3.2.43	"SERCA1 of 1001 aas.  Several 3-D structures are known (e.g., 3W5B). One has an ATP analogue, a Mg2+ and two Ca2+ ions in the respective binding sites (Toyoshima and Mizutani 2004). In this state, the ATP reorganizes the three cytoplasmic domains (A, N and P), which are widely separated without nucleotide, by directly bridging the N and P domains. The structure of the P-domain itself is altered by the binding of the ATP analogue and Mg2+. As a result, the A-domain is tilted so that one of the TMSs moves to lock the cytoplasmic gate of the transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites. This appears to be the mechanism for occluding the bound Ca2+ ions, before releasing them into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Toyoshima and Mizutani 2004). Molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence for the role of the Mg2+ and K+ bound states in the transport mechanism (Espinoza-Fonseca et al. 2014).  Animal SERCAs are inhibited by three short single TMS membrane proteins, phospholamban (TC# 1.A.50.1), sarcolipin (1.A.50.2) and myoregulin (1.A.50.3), and the inhibitory actions of these peptides on SERCA are counteracted by a peptide called DWORF (Dwarf ORF) (Nelson et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2015).  Norimatsu et al. 2017 have resolved the first layer of phospholipids surrounding the 
transmembrane helices. Phospholipids follow the movements 
of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in 
thickness of the bilayer. The entire protein tilts during 
the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to 
minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of 
the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side 
chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for 
conformational switching (Norimatsu et al. 2017). The human ortholog (O14983) is 96% identical to this rabbit enzyme.  These enzymes are inhibited by the fungal mycotoxins, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin (Darby et al. 2016; Houdou et al. 2019). The human ortholog is 97% identical and is of the same length. The SERCA residue Glu340 mediates interdomain communication that guides Ca2+ transport (Geurts et al. 2020). The SERCA Ca2+-ATPase may serve as a calcium-sensitive membrane-endoskeleton sensor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Nakamura et al. 2021). The C-terminal proton release pathway is a functional element of SERCA which provides a mechanistic model for its operation in the catalytic cycle of the pump (Espinoza-Fonseca 2021)."	Animals

3.A.3.2.5	The Golgi Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPase, human SPCA1 or SPCA1a (secretory-pathway Ca2+-ATPases (SPCAs)), ATP2C1 or Hussy-28 (efflux) (the Hailey-Hailey disease protein) is involved in responses to Golgi stress, apoptosis and mid-gestational death (Okunade et al., 2007). SPCA1 transports Mn2+  from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen. Increasing Golgi Mn2+  transport increased cell viability upon Mn2+ exposure, supporting a role in the management of Mn2+-induced neurotoxicity (Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt, 2011). SPCA1 governs the stability of TMEM165 (TC# 2.A.106.2.2) in Hailey-Hailey disease (Roy et al. 2020). Loss of ATP2C1 leads to impaired Notch1 signalling; ATP2C1-loss could promote a mechanism by which NOTCH1 is endocytosed and degraded (Zonfrilli et al. 2023).  Six cryo-EM structures of hSPCA1 in a series of intermediate states have revealed its near-complete conformational cycle (Wu et al. 2023). With the aid of molecular dynamics simulations, these structures offer a clear structural basis for Ca2+ entry and release in hSPCA1. hSPCA1 undergoes unique conformational changes during ATP binding and phosphorylation compared to other well-studied P-type II ATPases. In addition, a conformational distortion of the Ca2+-binding site induced by the separation of transmembrane helices 4L and 6 unveiling a distinct Ca2+ release mechanism. A structure of the long-sought CaE2P state of P-type IIA ATPases provided insight into the Ca2+ transport cycle (Wu et al. 2023). Structures of human SPCA1a in the ATP and Ca2+/Mn2+-bound (E1-ATP) state and the metal-free phosphorylated (E2P) state at 3.1- to 3.3-Å resolutions (Chen et al. 2023). The structures revealed that Ca2+ and Mn2+ share the same metal ion-binding pocket with similar but notably different coordination geometries in the transmembrane domain, corresponding to the second Ca2+-binding site in sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).

3.A.3.2.7	"The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, SERCA2b or ATP2A2, is encoded by the ATP2A2 gene.  Mutatioins give rise to Darier''s disease; the spectrum of mutations have been related to patients' phenotypes (Ahn et al., 2003; Godic et al. 2010).  SERCA1 functions as a heat generator in mitochondria of brown adipose tissue (de Meis et al., 2006). It normally functions as a Ca2+:H+  antiporter (Karjalainen et al., 2007).  Capsaicin converts SERCA to a Ca2+  non-transporting ATPase that generates heat, and is thus a natural drug that augments uncoupled SERCA, resulting in thermogenesis (Mahmmoud, 2008b). Oligomeric interactions of the N-terminus of sarcolipin with the Ca-ATPase have been documented (Autry et al., 2011), and these interactions also uncouple ATP hydrolysis from Ca2+ transport (Sahoo et al. 2015) resulting in thermogenesis.  TMS 11, absent in SERCA1a and SERCA2a, functions in regulation (Gorski et al. 2012). The bovine SERCA has also been crystallized (2.9 Å resolution; Sacchetto et al., 2012).  These enzymes are regulated differentially by phospholamban (PLN; 1.A.50.1.1) and sarcolipin (SLN; 1.A.50.2.1) as noted above (Gorski et al. 2013).  SERCA2 is regulated by TMEM64 (9.B.27.5.1), a 380 aa 6 TMS membrane protein of the DedA family (TC# 9.B.27) which regulates Ca2+ oscillations by direct interaction with CIRCA2, modulating its activity and influencing osteoblast differentiation (Kim et al. 2013).   Animal SERCAs are inhibited by three short single (C-terminal) TMS membrane 
proteins, phospholamban (TC# 1.A.50.1), sarcolipin (1.A.50.2) and 
myoregulin (1.A.50.3), and the inhibitory actions of these peptides on 
SERCA are counteracted by a peptide called DWORF (Dwarf ORF) (Nelson et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2015).  Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1; TC#8.A.28.1.2) and
sarcolipin (TC# 1.A.50.2.1) interact in their transmembrane domains to regulate SERCA (Desmond et al. 2017). Reduced SERCA function preferentially affects Wnt signaling by retaining E-cadherin in the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes apoptosis (Suisse and Treisman 2019). There is strong coupling between the chronological order of deprotonation, the entry of water molecules into the TM region, and the opening of the cytoplasmic gate. Deprotonation of E309 and E771 is sequential with E309 being the first to lose the proton. Deprotonation promotes the opening of the cytoplasmic gate but leads to a productive gating transition only if it occurs after the transmembrane domain has reached an intermediate conformation (Rui et al. 2018). Coordination at cation binding sites I and II is optimized for Ca2+ and to a lesser extent for Mg2+ and K+ (Sun et al. 2019). Methyglyoxal reacts with and inhibits SERCA (Zizkova et al. 2018). The phospholamban pentamer alters the function of SERCA (Glaves et al. 2019). TMS11 followed by the luminal tail is inhibitory. Inoue et al. 2019 determined the crystal structures of SERCA2b and its C-terminal splicing variant SERCA2a, both in the E1-2Ca2+-adenylylmethylenediphosphonate (AMPPCP) state. TMS11 is located adjacent to TMS10 and interacts weakly with a part of the L8/9 loop as well as the N-terminal end of TMS10, thereby inhibiting the SERCA2b catalytic cycle (Inoue et al. 2019). Accordingly, mutational disruption of the interactions between TMS11 and its neighboring residues caused SERCA2b to display SERCA2a-like ATPase activity. The authors proposed that TMS11 serves as a key modulator of SERCA2b activity by fine-tuning the intramolecular interactions with other transmembrane regions. Kabashima et al. 2020 revealed what ATP binding does to the Ca2+ pump and how nonproductive phosphoryl transfer is prevented in the absence of Ca2+. They reported that the A-domain takes an E1 position, and the N-domain occupies exactly the same position as that in the E1.ATP.2Ca2+ state relative to the P-domain. As a result, ATP is properly delivered to the phosphorylation site. Yet phosphoryl transfer never takes place without filling the two transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites. This explains what ATP binding does to SERCA, and how nonproductive phosphorylation is prevented in E2 (Kabashima et al. 2020). Nonannular lipid binding is not necessary for the stability of the E2 state but may become functionally significant during the E2-to-E1 transition (Espinoza-Fonseca 2019). Structural changes induced by the binding of rutin arachidonate to SERCA1a may shift proton balance near the titrable residues Glu771 and Glu309 into neutral species, hence preventing the binding of calcium ions to the transmembrane binding sites and thus affecting calcium homeostasis (Rodríguez and Májeková 2020). SERCA2a is a key protein in the Ca2+ cycle during heart failure (Zhihao et al. 2020). Covalent conjugates of fullerene derivatives with xanthene dyes inhibit SERCA (Tatyanenko et al. 2020). Autophosphorylation of the pump with two bound Ca2+ ions triggers a large conformational change that opens a gate on the luminal side of the membrane allowing the release of the ions. In response to phosphorylation, the cytoplasmic domains are partially reconfigured into an intermediate state on the path toward the E2 state with a closed luminal gate (Thirman et al. 2021). In preB cells, loss of SERCA2 leads to reduced V(D)J recombination kinetics due to diminished RAG-mediated DNA cleavage (Chen et al. 2021). A series of structural changes may accompany the ordered dissociation of ADP, the A-domain rotation, and the rearrangement of the transmembrane (TM) helices. The luminal gate then opens to release Ca2+ toward the SR lumen. Intermediate structures on the pathway are stabilized by transient sidechain interactions between the A- and P-domains. Lipid molecules between TM helices play a key role in the stabilization (Kobayashi et al. 2021). Structural bases for the conformational and functional regulation of human SERCA2b have been reported (Zhang and Inaba 2022). DWARF interacts with SERCA and phospholamban (PLB), counteracting the inhibitory effect of PLB on SERCA (Rustad et al. 2023). p300-mediated acetylation of SERCA2a is a critical post-translational modification that decreases 
the pump's function and contributes to cardiac impairment in heart failure (Gorski et al. 2023). Therapeutic approaches targeting SERCA2 and associated proteasomes might protect against Cd2+-induced cytotoxicity and renal injury (Li et al. 2023). SERCA2 phosphorylation at serine 663 is a key regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis in heart diseases (Gonnot et al. 2023)."	Animals

3.A.3.3.6	"Plamsa membrane H+-ATPase, Pma1 (pumps protons out of the cell to generate a membrane potential and regulate cytosolic pH) (Liu et al., 2006; Petrov, 2009). TMSs 4,5,6 and 8 comprise the H+ pathway where essential and important residues have been identified (Miranda et al., 2010). Residues in the loop between TMSs 5 and 6 play roles in
protein stability, function, and insertion (Petrov 2015).  Pma1 interacts with the plamsa membrane Cch1/Mid1 (1.A.1.11.10) to regulate its activity by influencing the membrane potential (Cho et al. 2016).  Asp739 and Arg811 are important residues for the biogenesis and function of the enzyme as H+ transport determinants (Petrov 2017). Pma1, is a P3A-type ATPase and the primary protein component of the membrane compartment of Pma1 (MCP). Like other plasma membrane H+-ATPases, Pma1 assembles and functions as a hexamer, a property unique to this subfamily of P-type ATPases. It has been unclear how Pma1 organizes the yeast membrane into MCP microdomains, or why it is that Pma1 needs to assemble into a hexamer to establish the membrane electrochemical proton gradient. Zhao et al. 2021 reported a high-resolution cryo-EM study of native Pma1 hexamers embedded in endogenous lipids. The Pma1 hexamer encircles a liquid-crystalline membrane domain composed of 57 ordered lipid molecules. The Pma1-encircled lipid patch structure likely serves as the building block of the MCP. At pH 7.4, the carboxyl-terminal regulatory α-helix binds to the phosphorylation domains of two neighboring Pma1 subunits, locking the hexamer in the autoinhibited state. The regulatory helix becomes disordered at lower pH, leading to activation of the Pma1 hexamer. The activation process is accompanied by a 6.7 A downward shift and a 40 degrees rotation of transmembrane helices 1 and 2 that line the proton translocation path. The conformational changes enabled the authors to propose a detailed mechanism for ATP-hydrolysis-driven proton pumping across the plasma membrane (Zhao et al. 2021). An ER-accumulated mutant of yeast Pma1 causes membrane-related stress to induce the unfolded protein response (Phuong et al. 2023)."	Yeast
3.A.3.3.7	"Plasma membrane H+ ATPase, PMA1 or AHA1 of 949 aas ad 10 TMSs in a 2 + 2 + 6 TMS arrangement. Three isoforms, AHA1, 2 & 3, exhibit different kinetic properties (Palmgren and Christensen, 1994). Both the N- and C-termini are directly involved in controlling the pump activity (Ekberg et al., 2010). Methyl jasmonate elicits stomatal closure in many plant species including A. thaliana, and stomatal closure is
accompanied by large ion fluxes across the plasma membrane.  These events appear to be mediated by AHA1 (Yan et al. 2015). It  is involved in root nutrient uptake, epidermal stomatal opening, phloem sucrose loading and unloading, and hypocotyl cell elongation (Ding et al. 2021). Auxin activates two distinct, antagonistically acting signalling pathways that converge on rapid regulation of apoplastic pH, a causative determinant of growth. Cell surface-based TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE1 (TMK1) interacts with and mediates phosphorylation and activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPases for apoplast acidification, while intracellular canonical auxin signalling promotes net cellular H+ influx, causing apoplast alkalinization (Li et al. 2021). Hydrogen sulfide improves salt tolerance through persulfidation of PMA1 in Arabidopsis (Ma et al. 2023). H2S promotes the binding of PMA1 to the transcriptional growth-regulating factor 4 (GRF4) through persulfidation, and then activating PMA, thus improving the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis (Ma et al. 2023)."

inactive or leaky states. Allosteric regulation by pH gradients 
modulates the switch between these states but not the pumping or leakage
 rates (Veshaguri et al. 2016).  They dynamics of the pump have been examined (Guerra and Bondar 2015). AHA2 drives root cell expansion (Hoffmann et al. 2018). This protein is 81% identical to the barley (Hordeum vulgare) HA1 of 956 aas and 10 TMSs. Plasma membrane H+-ATPase (HA1 and HA2) activity and/or expression is important for regulating the activity of K+ transporters and channels under drought stress conditions (Cai et al. 2019). Herbivore exposure enhances A. nanus tolerance to salt stress by activating the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, increasing plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity, promoting cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation, and then restricting K+ leakage and reducing Na+ accumulation in the cytosol (Chen et al. 2020).  Anionic phospholipids stimulate the proton pumping activity of AHA2 (Paweletz et al. 2023)."

It mediates resistance to zinc poisoning. Boudehen et al. 2022 showed that zinc resistance also depends on a chaperone-like protein, PacL1 (Rv3269; TC# 8.A.201.1.1). PacL1 contains an N-terminal TMS, a cytoplasmic region with glutamine/alanine repeats and a C-terminal metal-binding motif (MBM). PacL1 binds Zn2+, but the MBM is required only at high zinc concentrations. PacL1 co-localizes with CtpC in dynamic foci in the mycobacterial plasma membrane, and the two proteins form high molecular weight complexes. Foci formation does not require flotillin or the PacL1 MBM. However, deletion of the PacL1 Glu/Ala repeats leads to loss of CtpC and sensitivity to zinc. Genes pacL1 and ctpC appear to be in the same operon, and homologous gene pairs are found in the genomes of other bacteria. PacL1 colocalizes and functions redundantly with other PacL orthologs in M. tuberculosis. Thus, PacL proteins may act as scaffolds that assemble P-ATPase-containing metal efflux platforms mediating bacterial resistance to metal poisoning (Boudehen et al. 2022)."	Actinobacteria

3.A.3.5.3	"Cu+-, Ag+-ATPase (efflux from the cytosol into the secretory pathway) (Barnes et al., 2005); ATP7B (Wilson's disease protein, α-chain) is continuously expressed in Purkinje neurons.  It delivers Cu+ to the ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, in liver and may also transport Fe2+ (Takeda et al., 2005). Critical roles for the COOH terminus of ATP7B in protein stability, trans-Golgi network retention, copper sensing, and retrograde trafficking have been reported (Braiterman et al. 2011).  Modeling suggests that Cu+-binding sites HMBDs 5 and 6 are most important for function (Gourdon et al. 2012).  ATP7B loads Cu+ into newly synthesized cupro-enzymes in the trans-Golgi network and exports excess
copper out of cells by trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.  Mutations causing disease can affect activity, stability or trafficking (Braiterman et al. 2014).  Cisplatin is a poor substrate relative to Cu+with a Km of 1 mμM, and copper and cisplatin compete with each other (Safaei et al. 2008). Veratridine can bind to a site at the mouth of the channel pore in the human cardiac sodium channel, NaV1.5 (Gulsevin et al. 2022). ATP7A/B contains a P-type ATPase core consisting of a membrane transport domain and three cytoplasmic domains, the A, P, and N domains, and a unique amino terminus comprising six consecutive metal-binding domains. Bitter et al. 2022 presented a cryo-EM structure of frog ATP7B in a copper-free state. Interacting with both the A and P domains, the metal-binding domains are poised to exert copper-dependent regulation of ATP hydrolysis coupled to transmembrane copper transport. A ring of negatively charged residues lines the cytoplasmic copper entrance that is presumably gated by a conserved basic residue sitting at the center. Within the membrane, a network of copper-coordinating ligands delineates a stepwise copper transport pathway. Copper binding leads to increased dynamics in the regulatory N-terminal domain of ATP7B (Orädd et al. 2022). P-type ATPases follow an alternating access mechanism, with inward-facing E1 and outward-facing E2 conformations. Salustros et al. 2022 presented structures that reach 2.7 Å resolution of a copper-specific P1B-ATPase in an E1 conformation, with complementing data and analyses. A domain arrangement that generates space for interaction with ion-donating chaperones, suggests direct Cu+ transfer to the transmembrane core. A methionine serves a key role by assisting the release of the chaperone-bound ion and forming a cargo entry site together with the cysteines of the CPC signature motif. Yang et al. 2023 presented cryo-EM structures of human ATP7B in the E1 state in the apo, the putative copper-bound, and the putative cisplatin-bound forms. In ATP7B, the N-terminal sixth metal-binding domain (MBD6) binds at the cytosolic copperentry site of the transmembrane domain (TMD), facilitating the delivery of copper from the MBD6 to the TMD. The sulfur-containing residues in the TMD of ATP7B mark the copper transport pathway. By comparing structures of the E1 state of human ATP7B with the E2-P(i) state of frog ATP7B, an ATP-driving copper transport model was proposed (Yang et al. 2023).  A single ATP7 gene is present in non-chordate animals while it is divided into ATP7A and ATP7B in chordates (Fodor et al. 2023)."

3.A.3.5.30	"Copper (Cu+) exporting P-ATPase, CopA (3-D structure known to 3.2 Å; PDB# 3RFU; Gourdon et al. 2011).  The internal surface of the ATPase interacts with the copper chaparone, CopZ (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2012).  A sulfur-lined metal transport pathway has been identified (Mattle et al. 2015).  Cu+ is bound at a high-affinity transmembrane-binding site in
trigonal-planar coordination with the Cys residues of the conserved CPC motif of transmembrane
segment 4 (C382 and C384) and the conserved Methionine residue of transmembrane segment 6 (M717 of the
MXXXS motif). These residues are also essential for transport (Mattle et al. 2015)."	Bacteria

3.A.3.5.32	Copper-transporting ATPase RAN1 or HMP7 (EC 3.6.3.4) (Protein HEAVY METAL ATPASE 7) (Protein RESPONSIVE TO ANTAGONIST 1). Receptors involved in ethylene signaling can acquire their copper load by different routes and adopt the metal ion from the plasma membrane either by sequential transfer from soluble chaperones of the ATX1-family via the ER-bound copper-transporting ATPase RAN1 or by direct transfer from the soluble chaperones (Hoppen and Groth 2020). ER-anchored SPL7 (Transcription factor) constitutes a cellular mechanism for the regulation of RAN1 in ethylene signaling and lays the foundation for investigating how Cu homeostatic conditions ethylene sensitivity in the developmental context (Yang et al. 2022).

3.A.3.5.37	Copper exporting ATPase, ATP7 of 1254 aas and 10 - 12 TMSs.  DmATP7 is the sole Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the human MNK and WND copper transporters. A regulatory element drives expression in all neuronal tissues examined and demonstrates copper-inducible, Mtf-1-dependent expression in the larval midgut. Thus, an important functional role for copper transport in neuronal tissues is implied. Regulation of DmATP7 expression is not used to limit copper absorption under toxic copper conditions. The protein localizes to the basolateral membrane of DmATP7 expressing midgut cells, supporting a role in export of copper from midgut cells (Burke et al. 2008).	ATP7 of Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly)
3.A.3.5.38	Cuprous ion (Cu+) exporter, CopB, of 785 aas and 8 TMSs in a 4 + 2 + 2 arrangement. The copper-transporting P1B-ATPases have been divided traditionally into two subfamilies, the P1B-1-ATPases or CopAs and the P1B-3-ATPases or CopBs. CopAs selectively export Cu+ whereas previous studies have suggested that CopBs are specific for Cu2+ export. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of Sphaerobacter thermophilus CopB (StCopB) showed that, while it does bind Cu2+, the binding site is not in the transmembrane domain (Purohit et al. 2018).  StCopB exhibits metal-stimulated ATPase activity in response to Cu+, but not Cu2+, indicating that it is actually a Cu+ transporter. Cu+ is coordinated by four sulfur ligands derived from conserved cysteine and methionine residues. The histidine-rich N-terminal region is required for maximal activity, but is inhibitory in the presence of divalent metal ions. P1B-1- and P1B-3-ATPases may therefore all transport Cu+ (Purohit et al. 2018).	CopB of Sphaerobacter thermophilus

3.A.3.5.42	Copper (Cu+) exporting ATPase of 1254 aas and 8 TMSs, CrpA. While the A. flavus protein has not been characterized at the date of this entry, the A. fumigatus ortholog has been (Werner et al. 2023). Cellular responses used by macrophages to counteract fungal infection is the accumulation of high phagolysosomal Cu levels to destroy ingested pathogens. A. fumigatus responds by activating high expression levels of crpA, which encodes a CrpA that actively transports excess Cu+ from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment (Werner et al. 2023). Deletion of CrpA fungal-unique amino acids 1-211, containing two N-terminal Cu-binding sites, moderately increased Cu-sensitivity but did not affect expression or localization to the ER and cell surface. Replacement of CrpA fungal-unique amino acids 542-556, consisting of an intracellular loop between the second and third TMSs resulted in ER retention of the protein and strongly increased Cu-sensitivity (Werner et al. 2023).	CrpA of Aspergillus flavus
3.A.3.5.43	Cu+ and or Cu2+ exporting ATPase, CuTP, with 2568 aas and 8 TMSs in a 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 TMS arrangement (Wunderlich 2022).	CuTP of Plasmodium falciparum
3.A.3.5.5	"Cu+, Ag+-ATPase (efflux) (Fan and Rosen, 2002).  There are two metal binding domains (MBDs). The distal N-terminal MBD1 possesses a function analogous to the metallochaperones of
related prokaryotic copper resistance systems and is involved in copper transfer to the
membrane-integral ion binding sites of CopA. In contrast, the proximal domain MBD2 has a regulatory
role by suppressing the catalytic activity of CopA in the absence of copper (Drees et al. 2015). The functions of Me2+ exporters are often supported by chaperone proteins, which scavenge the metal ions from the cytoplasm. A CopA chaperone is expressed in E. coli from the same gene that encodes the transporter (Meydan et al. 2017). Some ribosomes translating copA undergo programmed frameshifting, terminate translation in the -1 frame, and generate the 70 aa-long polypeptide CopA(Z), which helps cells survive toxic copper concentrations. The high efficiency of frameshifting is achieved by the combined stimulatory action of a ""slippery"" sequence, an mRNA pseudoknot, and the CopA nascent chain. Similar mRNA elements are not only found in the copA genes of other bacteria but are also present in ATP7B, the human homolog of copA, and direct ribosomal frameshifting in vivo (Meydan et al. 2017). Cu(i) (Cu+) pumps, of which CopA is an example, are primary-active electrogenic uniporters. The Cu+ translocation cycle does not require proton counter-transport, resulting in electrogenic generation of a transmembrane potential upon translocation of one Cu+ per ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic cycle (Abeyrathna et al. 2020)."	Bacteria
3.A.3.5.6	"Cu+-ATPase, ATP7A (MNK or Mc1) (efflux from the cytosol into the secretory pathway) (Menkes disease protein, α-chain) (Tümer 2013). It plays a role in systemic copper absorption in the gut and copper reabsorption in the kidney. In nonpolarized cells, the metal binding sites in the amino-terminal domain of MNK are required for copper-regulated trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (Greenough et al. 2004). It is expressed in Purkinje cells early in development and later in Bergmann glia.  In melanocytes, it delivers Cu2+ to tyrosinase (Barnes et al., 2005). ATP7A has dual functions: 1) it incorporates copper into copper-dependent enzymes; and 2) it maintains intracellular copper levels by removing excess copper from the cytosol. To accomplish both functions, the protein traffics between different cellular locations, depending on copper levels (Bertini and Rosato, 2008). The lumenal loop Met672-Pro707 of ATP7A binds metals and facilitates copper release from the intramembrane sites (Barry et al., 2011).  Modeling suggests that Cu+-binding sites HMBDs 5 and 6 are most important for function (Gourdon et al. 2012).  In addition to X-linked recessive
Menkes disease, mutations cause occipital horn syndrome and adult-onset distal motor neuropathy (Yi and Kaler 2014). p97/VCP interacts with ATP7A playing a role in motor neuron degeneration (Yi and Kaler 2018). 55 different mutations were located around the six copper binding sites and the ATP binding site. 76.7% of the mothers were carriers. Approximately half of the male siblings of patients with MNK were diagnosed with MNK (Fujisawa et al. 2019). It may play a role in melanosome (melanocyte) function (Wiriyasermkul et al. 2020)."

3.A.3.5.7	Cu+-Ag+-ATPase (efflux), CopA of 804 aas. Exhibits maximal activity at 75˚C (Cattoni et al., 2007). The 3-D structure of the ATP-binding domain has been solved (2HC8_A) (functions with the Cu+ chaperone, CopZ; 130aas) (González-Guerrero and Argüello, 2008). This protein has both N- and C- terminal metal binding domains (MBDs). The N-MBD exhibits a conserved ferredoxin-like fold, binds metals to CXXC, and regulates turnover. The C-MBD interacts with the ATP-binding (ATPB) domain and the actuator (A) domain (Agarwal et al., 2010). Cysteine is a non-essential activator of CopA, interacting with the cytoplasmic side of the enzyme in the E1 form (Yang et al. 2007).	Euryarchaea

3.A.3.6.25	"Cd2+/Zn2+/Co2+ export ATPase, ZntA, of 904 aas and 8 TMSs. Expression of the zntA gene is inducible by all three metal ions, with Cd2+ being the most potent, mediated by the MerR-like regulator, ZntR (Chaoprasid et al. 2015). zntA and zntR mutants 
were highly sensitive to CdCl2 and ZnCl2, and less sensitive to CoCl2. Inactivation of zntA increased the accumulation of 
intracellular cadmium and zinc and conferred hyper-resistance to H2O2. 
Thus, ZntA and its regulator, ZntR, are important 
for controlling zinc homeostasis and cadmium and cobalt detoxification.

3.A.3.7.1	K+-ATPase (uptake), KdpFABC. (KdpA is homologous to other K+ transporters such as KcsA (1.A.1.1.1), KtrB (2.A.38.4.2 and 2.A.38.4.3), and HKT (2.A.38.3.1 and 2.A.38.3.2); KdpB is homologous to P-ATPase α-subunits; KdpC and KdpF may facilitate complex assembly and stabilize the complex (Bramkamp et al., 2007; Haupt et al., 2005; Greie and Altendorf, 2007; Irzik et al., 2011).  The KdpFABC acts as a functional and structural dimer with the two KdpB subunits in direct contact, but the enzyme can dissociate to the monomer (Heitkamp et al., 2008).  KdpF is part of and stabilizes the KdpABC complex (Gassel et al., 1999).  Transcription of the kdp operon is activated by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator pair, and unphosphorylated IIANtr of the PTS (TC# 4.A) binds KdpD to stimulate its activity, thereby enhancing kdp operon expression (Lüttmann et al. 2009, Lüttmann et al. 2015). Transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas putida kdpFABC operon by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator by direct interaction of IIANtr of the PTS with KdpD has also been studied (Wolf et al. 2015). The 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB has been solved (Huang et al. 2017). The structure reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits: a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites, and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. A mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes was proposed (Huang et al. 2017). The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of KdpD functions as a K+ sensor (Rothenbücher et al. 2006). Serine phosphorylated KdpB is trapped in a conformation where the ion-binding site is hydrated via an intracellular pathway between TMSs M1 and M2 which opens in response to the rearrangement of cytoplasmic domains, resulting from phosphorylation (Dubey et al. 2021). This causes pump inhibition in the presence of high K+ resulting in ATP conservation.	Bacteria; proteobacteria
3.A.3.7.2	High affinity potassium uptake ATPase, KdpABC.  Regulated by direct interaction of the IIANtr protein with the sensor kinase/response regulator, KdpDE (Prell et al. 2012).	Proteobacteria
3.A.3.7.3	Potassium transporter, KdpABC, with 3 subunits:  KdpA, B2HPR5, 552 aas and 10 TMSs in a 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 arrangement; KdpB ATPase, B2HRP6, 693 aas and 7  TMSs in a 2 + 2 + 3 TMS arrangement, and KdpC, D2HRP7, 296 aas with one N-terminal TMS and possibly one C-terminal TMS.  A kdpA null mutantion reduced the fraction of persisters after exposure to rifampicin (Liu et al. 2020). kdpA encodes a transmembrane protein that is part of the Kdp-ATPase, an ATP-dependent high-affinity potassium (K+) transport system. kdpA expression is induced under low K+ conditions and is required for pH homeostasis and growth in media with low concentrations of K+. Inactivation of the Kdp system caused hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, increased the proton motive force (PMF) and elevated levels of intracellular ATP. The KdpA mutant phenotype could be complemented with a functional kdpA gene or supplementation with high K+ concentrations. Thus, the Kdp system is required for ATP homeostasis and persister formation. ATP-mediated regulation of persister formation may be a general mechanism in bacteria, and suggest that K+ transporters may play a role in the regulation of ATP levels and persistence (Liu et al. 2020).

3.A.3.8.1	Golgi Aminophospholipid (phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl ethanolamine) translocase (flipping from the exofacial to the cytosolic leaflet of membranes to generate phospholipid asymmetry), required for vesicle-mediated protein transport from the Golgi and endosomes. The system has been reconstituted after purification in proteoliposomes. It flips phosphatidyl serine but not phosphatidylcholine or sphinogomyelin (Zhou and Graham, 2009).  A unified mechanism of flipping for ABC and P-type ATPases has been proposed (López-Marqués et al. 2014).	Animals
3.A.3.8.10	Lipid flippase, Apt1 (involved in stress tolerance and virulence). Deletion of Apt1 causes (1) altered actin distribution, (2) increased sensitivity to stress conditions (oxidative and nitrosative stress) and to trafficking inhibitors, such as brefeldin A and monensin, a reduction in exported acid phosphatase activity, and (3) hypersensitivity to the antifungal drugs amphotericin B, fluconazole, and cinnamycin (Hu and Kronstad, 2010).	Yeast
3.A.3.8.11	Phospholipid (e.g., cardiolipin) transporter, Atp8b1 or ATP881 which functions with CDC50A (see TC# 8.A.27.1.5).  The structural basis of a broad lipid specificity of ATP8B1 has been determined (Dieudonné et al. 2023). Phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin are transport substrates. A critical role of the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids is important (Dieudonné et al. 2023). A mutant version is associated with severe pneumonia in humans and mice. It binds and internalizes cardiolipin and other phospholipids from extracellular fluid via a basic residue-enriched motif. Administration of a peptide encompassing the cardiolipin binding motif of the Atp8b1 gene product in mice lessens bacterium-induced lung injury and improves survival (Ray et al., 2010).  Mutations have been identified that give rise to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (Stone et al. 2012).  This lipid flippase forms a heterodimer with CDC50A/Transmembrane protein 30A (TC# 8.A.27.1.5) and is essential for surface expressioin of the apical Na+-bile acid transporter, Slc10A2/ASBT (TC#2.A.28.1.2) (van der Mark et al. 2014; Schlosser et al. 2023).

3.A.3.8.12	Probable phospholipid-transporting ATPase IF (EC 3.6.3.1) (ATPase IR) (ATPase class VI type 11B). Among the ATP10 and ATP11 proteins of P4-ATPases, ATP10A, ATP10D, ATP11A, and ATP11C localize to the plasma membrane, while ATP10B and ATP11B localize to late endosomes and early/recycling endosomes, respectively. The N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of P4-ATPases determine their cellular localization (Okamoto et al. 2020).	Animals
3.A.3.8.13	P4 phospholipid (phosphatidyl serine)-transporting ATPase 8A1 (EC 3.6.3.1) (ATPase class I type 8A member 1) (Chromaffin granule ATPase II).  Also found in the liver canicular membrane (Chaubey et al. 2016). The 3-D strcutures of 6 distinct intermediates (2.6 - 3.3 Å resolution) of the complex of this protein with CDC50A (TC# 8.A.27.1.5) have been solved, revealing the transport cycle for lipid flipping (Hiraizumi et al. 2019). ATP-dependent phosphorylation induces a large rotational movement of the actuator domain around the phosphorylation site in the phosphorylation domain, accompanied by lateral shifts of the first and second TMSs, thereby allowing phosphatidylserine binding. The phospholipid head group passes through the hydrophilic cleft, while the acyl chain is exposed toward the lipid environment (Hiraizumi et al. 2019). The phospholipid binds to ATP8A1-CDC50 at an early stage when ATP8A1-CDC50 changes from E2P to E2Pi-PL state (Zhang et al. 2023). TMEM30A is an essential subunit of P4-ATPase phospholipid flippases (Li et al. 2023). Distinct domains in Ndc1 mediate its interaction with the Nup84 complex and the nuclear membrane (Amm et al. 2023). Ndc1 functions in NPC assembly at the fused inner and outer nuclear membranes. A direct interaction of Ndc1's transmembrane domain with Nup120 and Nup133, members of the pore membrane coating Y-complex. An amphipathic helix in Ndc1's C-terminal domain binds highly curved liposomes. Ndc1's amphipathic motif functionally interacts with related motifs in the C-terminus of the nucleoporins Nup53 and Nup59, important for pore membrane binding and interconnecting NPC modules. The essential function of Ndc1 can be suppressed by deleting the amphipathic helix from Nup53 (Amm et al. 2023).  It is a possible drug target for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs), rare neuroendocrine tumors (Vit et al. 2023).	Animals
3.A.3.8.14	"ATP11C (ATPIG, ATPIQ) aminophospholipid (phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, but not phosphatidyl choline) flippase of 1132 aas and 10 TMSs.  It is dependent on CDC50A (1232 aas and 9 TMSs, Anoctamin-8, Ano8; TC#1.A.17.1.30), for proper localization to the plasma membrane, and possibly also for activity (Segawa et al. 2014).  Present in liver basolateral membranes (Chaubey et al. 2016). It is the only phospholipid flipping ATPase in the human red blood cell (Liou et al. 2019). In the cell membrane of erythrocytes, it is 
required to maintain phosphatidylserine (PS) in the inner leaflet 
preventing its exposure on the surface. This asymmetric distribution is 
critical for the survival of erythrocytes in circulation since 
externalized PS is a phagocytic signal for splenic macrophages (Arashiki et al. 2016).
 Phospholipid translocation seems also to be implicated in vesicle 
formation and in the uptake of lipid signaling molecules, and is required for B cell differentiation past the pro-B cell stage It seems to mediate PS flipping in pro-B cells and may be involved in the transport of cholestatic bile acids.  Caspase-dependent inactivation of ATP11C is essential for an apoptotic ""eat me"" signal, phosphatidylserine exposure, which prompts phagocytes to engulf cells. Nakanishi et al. 2020 presented six cryo-EM structures of ATP11C at 3.0-4.0 A resolution in five different states of the transport cycle. A structural comparison revealed phosphorylation-driven domain movements coupled with phospholipid binding. Three structures of phospholipid-bound states visualize phospholipid translocation accompanied by the rearrangement of transmembrane helices and an unwound portion at the occlusion site. They thus detail the basis for head group recognition and the locality of the protein-bound acyl chains in transmembrane grooves. Invariant Lys880 and the surrounding hydrogen-bond network serve as a pivot point for helix bending and precise P domain inclination, which is crucial for dephosphorylation. The structures detail key features of phospholipid translocation by ATP11C; a common basic mechanism for flippases is emerging (Nakanishi et al. 2020)."	Animals
3.A.3.8.15	"Phospholipid transporting ATPase, Tat1 of 1139 aas.  Transports phosphatidylserine from the 
outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining 
the enrichment of this phospholipid in the inner leaflet. Ectopic 
exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface may result in removal
 of living cells by neighboring phagocytes in an apoptotic process (Darland-Ransom et al. 2008).  Tat1 regulates lysosome biogenesis and endocytosis as well as yolk uptake in oocytes. It is required at multiple steps
of the endolysosomal pathway, at least in part by ensuring proper trafficking of cell-specific
effector proteins (Ruaud et al. 2009). TAT-1 and its chaperone, the 
Cdc50 family protein CHAT-1, maintain membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) 
asymmetry, which is required for membrane tubulation during endocytic 
sorting and recycling. Loss of tat-1 and chat-1 disrupts endocytic 
sorting, leading to defects in both cargo recycling and degradation. Chen et al. 2019 identified the C. elegans aspartyl aminopeptidase DNPP-1,
 loss of which suppresses the sorting and recycling defects in tat-1 mutants without reversing the PS asymmetry defect."	Tat1 of Caenorhabditis elegans

maintenance of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids. Phospholipid 
translocation seems also to be implicated in vesicle formation and in 
uptake of lipid signaling molecules. May be involved in the 
uptake of farnesyltransferase inhibitory drugs, such as lonafarnib (Zhang et al. 2005). A sublethal ATP11A mutation is associated with neurological deterioration due to aberrant phosphatidylcholine flipping in plasma membranes (Segawa et al. 2021)."	ATP11A of Homo sapiens

3.A.3.8.2	"Golgi aminophospholipid translocase (flipping from the exofacial to the cytosolic leaflet of membranes), required for vesicle-mediated protein transport from the Golgi and endosomal lumen to the cytoplasm, Gea2p (Pomorski et al., 2003). The system has been reconstituted after purification in proteoliposomes. It flips phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, but not phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin (Zhou and Graham, 2009).  Drs2p (ACT3; ATP8A2) is required for phospholipid translocation across the
 Golgi membrane. It interacts with CDC50 (TC# 8.A.27) (Bryde et al., 2010). Activated by ArfGEF when bound to the C-terminus (Natarajan et al. 2009). The
 beta-subunit, CDC50A, allows the stable expression, assembly, 
subcellular localization, and lipid transport activity of the P4-ATPase 
ATP8A2 (Coleman and Molday, 2011). Timcenko et al. 2019 described the cryo-EM structure of Drs2p-Cdc50p, It is autoinhibited by the C-terminal tail of Drs2p and activated by the lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). Three structures were solved that represent the complex in an autoinhibited, an intermediate and a fully activated state. The analysis revealed sites of autoinhibition and PI4P-dependent activation. A putative lipid translocation pathway involves a conserved PISL motif in TMS 4 and polar residues of TMSs 2 and 5, in particular Lys1018, in the centre of the lipid bilayer (Timcenko et al. 2019). The enzymatic cycle of P-type ATPases is divided into autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation half-reactions. Unlike most other P-type ATPases, P4-ATPases transport their substrate during dephosphorylation only, i.e. the phosphorylation half-reaction is not associated with transport. To study the structural basis of the distinct mechanisms of P4-ATPases, Timcenko et al. 2021 determined cryo-EM structures of Drs2p-Cdc50p covering multiple intermediates of the cycle. They identified several structural motifs specific to Drs2p and P4-ATPases in general that decrease movements and flexibility of domains as compared to other P-type ATPases. These motifs include the linkers that connect the transmembrane region to the actuator (A) domain, which is responsible for dephosphorylation. Mutation of Tyr380, which interacts with conserved Asp340 of the distinct DGET dephosphorylation loop of P4-ATPases, highlights a functional role of these P4-ATPase specific motifs in the A-domain. Finally, the transmembrane (TM) domain, responsible for transport, also undergoes less extensive conformational changes, which is ensured both by a longer segment connecting TM helix 4 with the phosphorylation site, and possible stabilization by the auxiliary subunit Cdc50p. Collectively these adaptions in P4-ATPases are responsible for phosphorylation becoming transport-independent (Timcenko et al. 2021). The Arf activator, Gea2p (Uniprot P39993, 1459 aas), and Drs2p interact in the Golgi (Chantalat et al. 2004)."	Fungi

complex which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled to the transport 
of aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of various 
membranes and ensures the maintenance of asymmetric distribution of 
phospholipids. Phospholipid translocation has been implicated in
 vesicle formation and in the uptake of lipid signaling molecules. ATP10D reduces high-fat diet induced obesity and improves insulin sensitivity (Sigruener et al. 2017). It also transports glycosphingolipids including glucosphinolipids (Roland et al. 2019)."	Atp10d of Homo sapiens

Among the ATP10 and ATP11 proteins of P4-ATPases, ATP10A, ATP10D, ATP11A, and ATP11C localize to the plasma membrane, while ATP10B and ATP11B localize to late endosomes and early/recycling endosomes, respectively.

3.A.3.8.4	Inwardly directed phospholipid and lysophospholipid (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl serine and lysophosphoethanolamine) flippase, Dnf1 or ATP11C (functions with the β-subunit, Lem3 or CDC50A (TC# 8.A.27.1.5) (Elvington et al., 2005; Pomorski et al., 2003; Riekhof and Voelker, 2006; Riekhof et al., 2007) Also transports the anti-neoplastic and anti-parasitic ether lipid substrates related to edelfosine (Riekhof and Voelker, 2009) (not required for phosphotidyl serine inwardly directed flipping (Stevens et al. 2008)). Transports diacyl phospholipids in preference to lyso (monoacyl) phospholipids (Baldridge et al. 2013).  A conserved asparagine (N220) in the first transmembrane segment specifies glycerophospholipid binding and transport, but specific substitutions at this site allow transport of sphingomyelin (Roland and Graham 2016). It transports glycosphingolipids (Roland et al. 2019). Nakanishi et al. 2020 presented the crystal structures of a human plasma membrane flippase, the ATP11C-CDC50A complex, in a stabilized E2P conformation. The structure revealed a deep longitudinal crevice along transmembrane helices continuing from the cell surface to the phospholipid occlusion site in the middle of the membrane. The extension of the crevice on the exoplasmic side was open, and the complex was therefore in an outward-open E2P state, similar to a cryo-EM structure of the yeast flippase Drs2p-Cdc50p complex. Phosphatidylserines were in the crevice and in its extension to the extracellular side. One was close to the phosphatidylserine occlusion site as previously reported for the human ATP8A1-CDC50A complex, and the other in a cavity at the surface of the exoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer. Substitutions in either of the binding sites or along the path between them impaired ATPase and transport activities. Thus, the crevice is the conduit along which phosphatidylserine traverses the membrane (Nakanishi et al. 2020).	Yeast
3.A.3.8.5	Inwardly directed phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl serine, and lysophosphoethanolamine flippase, Dnf2 (functions with the β-subunit, Lem3) (Elvington et al., 2005; Pomorski et al., 2003; Riekhof and Voelker, 2006; Riekhof et al., 2007). This plasma membrane P-type ATPase (ACT4) is a phospholipid flippase that contributes to endocytosis, protein transport and all polarity (Hua et al., 2002). Transports monoacyl (lyso) phospholipids much better than diacyl phospholipids, but can be mutated to transport diacyl phospholipids (Baldridge et al. 2013). It transports glycosphingolipids (Roland et al. 2019).	Yeast

3.A.3.8.8	The phosphatidylserine flippase in photoreceptor disc membranes, ATP8A2 (Coleman et al., 2009). The beta-subunit, CDC50A (TC#8.A.27.1.5), allows the stable expression, assembly, subcellular localization, and lipid transport activity of ATP8A2 (Coleman and Molday, 2011).  Missennse mutations in ATP8A2 are associated with cerebellar atrophy and guadrupedal locomotion (Emre Onat et al. 2012). Asparagine-905 of the mammalian phospholipid flippase ATP8A2 is essential for lipid substrate-induced activation of ATP8A2 dephosphorylation (Mikkelsen et al. 2019). Phosphatidylserine flipping by the P4-ATPase, ATP8A2, is electrogenic (Tadini-Buoninsegni et al. 2019). Translocation of the lipid substrate toward the cytoplasmic bilayer leaflet is comparable to unzipping a zipper of salt bridges/hydrogen bonds (Mogensen et al. 2023).	Animals

1.A.34.1.1	"The Bacillus SpoIIQ/SpoIIIAH transcompartment channel interconnects the forespore and the mother cell. The activity of sigmaG requires this channel apparatus
through which the adjacent mother cell provides substrates that generally support gene expression in the forespore. Flanagan et al. 2016 reported that SpoIIQ is bifunctional, specifically maximizing sigmaG activity as part
of a regulatory circuit that prevents sigmaG from activating transcription of the
gene encoding its own inhibitor, the anti-sigma factor CsfB."	Bacteria

 the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those 
seen in the E. coli NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity is open to the 
outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved 
aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding directly. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a 
surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20° against the 
dimerization interface (Lee et al. 2013). A  transmembrane lysine residue is essential for electrogenic transport in this and related Na+/H+ antiporters(Uzdavinys et al. 2017)."	NapA of Thermus thermophilus
