2.A.1.11.3	Inner membrane protein BtsT or YhjX (probably a pyruvate:proton symporter that can also function as an exporter) (Vilhena et al. 2017). Regulated by Crp as well as the LytS-like histidine sensor kinase, BtsS or YehU, and the corresponding LytTR-like response regulator, BtsR or YehT (Kristoficova et al. 2017). Possibly induced by peptides as cells enter the stationary growth phase because they release extracellular pyruvate, the true inducer (Kristoficova et al. 2017). Forms a complex with the BtsT (CsiA; YjiY) transporter (TC# 2.A.114.1.9) and two sensor kinase/response regulator pairs, BtsS/BtsR (YehU/YehT) and YdpA/YdpB, both of which respond to extracellular pyruvate, but with differing affinities (Behr et al. 2014). The carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) is involved in posttranscriptional regulation of both BtsT (YjiY) and YjiX, a 67 aa soluble protein of unknown function (Behr et al. 2014). The two proteins, YhjX (TC# 2.A.1.11.3) and YjiY (TC# 2.A.114.1.9) may function together as an oligomer, and confusingly, have both been given the designation: BtsT (see UniProt entries).		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

2.A.1.6.4	(Proline/glycine-betaine):(H+/Na+) symporter, ProP (also transports taurine, ectoine, pipecolate, proline-betaine, N,N-dimethylglycine, carnitine, and 1-carboxymethyl-pyridinium) (subject to osmotic activation). Transmembrane helix I and periplasmic loop 1 are involved in osmosensing and osmoprotectant transport (Keates et al., 2010). ProP detects the increase in cytoplasmic cation concentration associated with osmotically induced cell dehydration and mediates osmolyte uptake into bacteria (Ozturk et al. 2020). ProP is a 12-TMS protein with an α-helical, cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) linked to TMS XII. The CTD helix associates with the anionic membrane surface to lock ProP in an inactive conformation. The release of the CTD may activate ProP. Molecular dynamics simulations showed specific intrapeptide salt bridges forming when the CTD associated with the membrane. The salt bridge Lys447-Asp455 weakened CTD-lipid interactions at 0.25 M KCl, and gradual stiffening of the membrane with increasing salinity was obseerved. Thus, salt cations may affect CTD release and activate ProP by increasing the order of membrane phospholipids (Ozturk et al. 2020). ProP forestalls cellular dehydration by detecting environments with high osmotic pressure and mediating the accumulation of organic osmolytes by bacterial cells. Structural determinants and functional significance of dimerization have been described (Ozturk et al. 2023).

Interactions between the tip of eL4 and the peptide backbone at the end of TMS 10 participate in coordinating conformational alterations underlying the alternating access mechanism of transport (Bracher et al. 2016). TMS 6 plays a central role in substrate (both Na+ and proline) binding and release on the inner side of the membrane, and functionally relevant amino acids have been identified (Bracher et al. 2016).

2.A.22.4.2	The amino acid (leucine):2 Na+ symporter, LeuTAa (Yamashita et al., 2005). LeuT possesses two ion binding sites, NA1 and NA2, both highly specific for Na+ but with differing mechanisms of binding (Noskov and Roux, 2008). X-ray structures have been determined for LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states (Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012). Extracytoplasmic substrate binding at an allosteric site controls activity (Zhao et al. 2011). It has been proposed that the 5 TMS repeat derived from a DedA domain (9.B.27; Khafizov et al. 2010). Mechanistic aspect of Na+ binding have been studied (Perez and Ziegler 2013). Structural studies of mutant LeuT proteins suggest how antidepressants bind to biogenic amine transporters (Wang et al. 2013). The detailed mechanism was studied by Zhao and Noskov, 2013. Uptake involves movement of the substrate amino acid from the outward facing binding site, S1, to the inward facing binding site, S2, coupled with confrmational changes in the protein (Cheng and Bahar 2013). The complete substrate translocation pathway has been proposed (Cheng and Bahar 2014). The inward facing conformation of LeuT has been solved (Grouleff et al. 2015). Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gatemay determinethe catalytic efficiency of the transporter (Billesbølle et al. 2015). Of the two Na+ binding sites, occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8 whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions (Tavoulari et al. 2015). TMS1A movements revealed a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred from the crystal structure, especiallly with respect to the inner vestibule (Sohail et al. 2016). Partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1, 5, 6 and7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state (Merkle et al. 2018). A conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site is required for substrate binding to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains (Zhang et al. 2018). The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has revealed the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020). This involves a major tilting of the cytoplasmic end of TMS5, which, together with release of the N-terminus but without coupled movement of TM1) opens a wide cavity towards the second Na+ binding site. The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has been solved, revealing the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020). In nine transporters having the LeuT fold, the bundle (first two TMSs of each 5 TMS repeat) rotates relative to the hash (third and fourth TMSs). Motions of the arms (fifth TMS) to close or open the intracellular and outer vestibules are common, as is a TMS1a swing, with notable variations in the opening-closing motions of the outer vestibule. These analyses suggest that LeuT-fold transporters layer distinct motions on a common bundle-hash rock (Licht et al. 2024). Thus, conformational movements in LeuT-fold transporters rock (Licht et al. 2024)	Amino acid (leucine):2 Na+ symporter, LeuTAa	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.A.22.5.3	Neurotransmitter:sodium symporter of 455 aas, MhsT.  The x-ray structures of two occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan have been solved (4US4; Malinauskaite et al. 2014).  These structures provide insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na+2 site. Solvation through this TMS 5 pathway may facilitate Na+ release from the Na+2 site to the inward-open state (Malinauskaite et al. 2014). TMS5 plays a role in the binding and release of Na+ from the Na+2 site and in mediating conformational changes (Stolzenberg et al. 2017). MhsT of Bacillus halodurans is a transporter of hydrophobic amino acids and a homologue of the eukaryotic SLC6 family of Na+ -dependent symporters for amino acids, neurotransmitters, osmolytes, and creatine. A non-helical region in TMS 6 of hydrophobic amino acid transporter MhsT mediates substrate recognition (Focht et al. 2020).

2.A.68.1.2	The drug resistance permease, MtrF (Folster and Shafer, 2005). The 3-d structure is known (Su et al. 2015).

Each subunit of the transporter contains nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins, posing a plausible pathway for substrate transport. A combination of the crystal structure and biochemical functional assays suggests that MtrF is an antibiotic efflux pump mediating bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs (Su et al. 2015). MtrF and YdaH, (TC#2.A.68.1.4) and the dicarboxylate transporter, INDY (TC#2.a.47.5.2) have been shown to have the same 3-d fold (Vergara-Jaque et al. 2015), confirming the assignment of these two families to the same superfamily (Prakash et al. 2003).

3.A.1.24.1	The L- and D-methionine porter (also transports formyl-L-methionine and other methionine derivatives) (Zhang et al., 2003). The 3.7A structure of MetNI has been solved. An allosteric regulatory mechanism operates at the level of transport activity, so increased intracellular levels of the transported ligand stabilize an inward-facing, ATPase-inactive state of MetNI to inhibit further ligand translocation into the cell (Kadaba et al., 2008).  The structure of an MetQ homologue in Neisseria meningitidis has been solved at 2.25 Å resolution revealing a bound methionine in the cleft between the two domains (Yang et al. 2009). Conformational changes in MetQ provide substrate access through the binding protein to the transmembrane translocation pathway. MetQ likely mediates uptake of methionine derivatives through two mechanisms: in the methionine-bound form, substrate is delivered from the periplasm to the transporter (the canonical mechanism) and in the apo form, it facilitates ligand binding when complexed to the transporter (the noncanonical mechanism). This dual role of substrate-binding proteins was proposed to provide a kinetic strategy for ABC transporters to transport both high- and low-affinity substrates present in a physiological concentration range (Nguyen et al. 2018).

3.A.1.3.10	Cystine/cysteine/diaminopimelate transporter, CysXYZ; these proteins are also designated FliY/YecS/YecC. Note, another transporter is designated CysZ in E. coli (TC# 2.A.121.1.1). CysXYZ also transports the toxic amino acid analogues, L-selenaproline (SCA; L-selenazolidine-4-carboxylic acid) and L-selenocystine (SeCys) (Deutch et al. 2014). FliY binds L-cystine, L-cysteine, and D-cysteine with micromolar affinities, but binding of the L- and D-enantiomers induced different conformational changes in FliY, where the L- enantiomer/SBP complex interacted more efficiently with the YecSC transporter. YecSC has low basal ATPase activity that is moderately stimulated by apo-FliY, more strongly by D-cysteine-bound FliY, and maximally by L-cysteine- or L-cystine-bound FliY (Sabrialabe et al. 2020). FliY may exist in a conformational equilibrium between an open, unliganded form that does not bind to the YecSC transporter and closed, unliganded and closed, liganded forms that bind this transporter with variable affinities but equally stimulate its ATPase activity. These findings differ from previous observations for similar ABC transporters, highlighting the extent of mechanistic diversity in this large protein family (Sabrialabe et al. 2020).

3.A.1.3.2	Three component ABC L-glutamine porter. The basal ATPase activity (ATP hydrolysis in the absence of substrate) is mainly caused by the docking of the closed-unliganded state of GlnH onto the transporter domain of GlnPQ. Unlike glutamine, arginine binds both GlnH domains, but does not trigger their closing. Comparison of the ATPase activity in nanodiscs with glutamine transport in proteoliposomes suggested that the stoichiometry of ATP per substrate is close to two (Lycklama A Nijeholt et al. 2018). Glutamine transporters are effective targets for digestive system malignant tumor treatment (Chu et al. 2024).	ABC L-glutamine transporter	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

3.A.1.3.25	Glutamine transporter, GlnQP. Takes up glutamine, asparagine and glutamate which compete for each other for binding to the substrate/transmembrane protein constituent of the system (Fulyani et al. 2015). Tandem substrate binding domains differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single ABC transporter. Analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity (Fulyani et al. 2013). Protein-protein interactions and conformational states were studied simultaneously using PIFE-FRET (Ploetz et al. 2021). GlnPQ from L. lactis has two sequential covalently linked substrate-binding domains (SBDs), which capture the substrates and deliver them to the translocon. The two SBDs differ in their ligand specificities, binding affinities and the distance to the transmembrane domain, but both SBDs can bind their ligands simultaneously without affecting each other. Nemchinova et al. 2024 studied the binding of ligands to both SBDs; three high-resolution structures of SBD1, namely, the wild-type SBD1 with bound asparagine or arginine, and E184D SBD1 with glutamine bound were examined. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided insight into the dynamics associated with open-closed transitions of the SBDs.

These revealed one binding site for substrate per ArtQ monomer.  Heuveling et al. 2018 then showed that in the close homologue, ArtMP of Geobacillus stearothermophilus, that just one of these two sites needed to bind substrate to get transport.

Zhou and Bushweller 2018 computationally modeled and experimentally validated an inward-facing state, which suggests that CcdA uses an elevator-type movement to shuttle the reactive cysteines across the membrane. Its structure may be relevant to other LysE superfamily transporters.
